"A New Understanding of Will - And Maybe Yourself","I am a big fan of biographical works and of both Mark Manson and Will Smith; and yet, this book leaves me feeling bittersweet.  Will Smith has spent decades in our most beloved cultural works: Fresh Prince, Hitch, I Am Legend, Bad Boys, and Big Willie style to name a few.  In many ways the thing we loved most about him wasn't his incredible catalog of work, but the ""effortless"" charisma that allowed him to take over the world.  This book cuts directly against that image. This book amounts to look behind the curtain of what made this icon who he is, warts and all.  While it is incredibly insightful and well written - those of us who liked having him up on a pedestal for being superhuman will realize that he is imperfect like us all. What you get in this book is life experiences from Will wrapped around singular ideas like ""fear"", ""Power"" and ""Hope"" and he uses those themes and stories to teach us lessons about life.  This book left me with a new understanding of Will and myself -  in my opinion, that's all a great biographical works should do.","09 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Danny nixs","5.0","Will","https://www.amazon.com/Will-Smith-ebook/product-reviews/B093PF9F5G/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"The most life changing read","This book isn‚Äôt just incredible because it‚Äôs funny and the stories are personal, it‚Äôs truly life changing. The arc of from fear to love is transformative.

"Pure Will","Smith has poured his heart & soul into this book, digging deep to share his vast wisdom and personal truth. You get a rare insight into the vulnerability and bravery of an individual so driven that it inspires you to be better. A story about the lessons he learned from laying brick with his dad got me good. (You gotta read it to find out, I‚Äôm not a spoiler!) Bottom line: this book echoes a life well-lived and the end result is nothing short of pure Will.","09 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Bryan Philip Cruz","5.0","Will","https://www.amazon.com/Will-Smith-ebook/product-reviews/B093PF9F5G/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"One of the best memoirs I've read; funny and conversational, inspirational and painful","This book has 21 main chapters, and total of 411 pages.  At the end of the book there are 64 pictures of Will and his family members; from pictures of his parents before he was born, to pictures of him as a child, pictures with extended family members, on the set of TV shows and movies, and with his children. The book starts with a prologue about an important lesson Smith learned from his dad as he was laying bricks to build a wall with his brother.  Then the first chapter deals with Smith's childhood, as he recalls  his early years being defined by a sense of fear.  He describes his parents and how they met, and how they became a family of six, with his older half-sister Pam and his twin siblings Harry and Ellen.  There are heartbreaking stories of domestic violence that the kids witnessed, and Smith was deeply affected by these incidents. Over the next few chapters Smith describes his life as he grew up.  He touches on his vivid imagination, his love of performing and making people laugh, being introduced to hip-hop by his older cousin Paul, meeting DJ Jazzy Jeff, and going on tour with other hip-hop acts.  The next few chapters cover other major events in Smith's life: winning the first Grammy for a rap artist, getting his heart broken by his girlfriend, his popularity fading after his lackluster third album, going broke, hitting rock bottom, meeting Quincy Jones, and starting the Fresh Prince of Bel Air TV show.  Smith goes on to describe his success on TV, and transition to his goal of becoming a movie star.  He covers his first marriage, the birth of his first son Trey, getting divorced, and falling in love with Jada Pinkett.  Over the rest of the book, Smith describes many other experiences he had, and his attempts at balancing a successful acting career with his growing family, after the birth of Jaden and Willow. Overall I enjoyed reading this book.  Smith's conversational tone and storytelling ability make this book more of a page turner than other memoirs I've read.  I learned so much about his family, and the experiences that shaped his personality.  The pictures at the end were nice addition as well, and many of them have funny captions that highlight Smith's sense of humor.","09 Nov 2021","","","Yes","C","5.0","Will","https://www.amazon.com/Will-Smith-ebook/product-reviews/B093PF9F5G/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"A well-written memoir, wild stories and powerful lessons from a music legend","This book is divided into five main parts, with a total of 24 chapters, and about 376 pages in the digital version In the Introduction, Grohl describes an epiphany he had when he realized how he wanted to age: ‚ÄúI would celebrate the ensuing years by embracing the toll they'd take on me.‚Äù  He also explains that his memory is triggered by sound, and his recollections of the events in his life are mostly centered around songs, albums, and bands that he was apart of. From the very beginning of the book, Grohl's ability to eloquently communicate his experiences is on full display.  Perhaps this should not be surprising given his years of songwriting, but I was still impressed with his ability to produce such well-written and evocative prose.  Songwriting skills don't always translate to being able to write a book, but clearly Grohl can do both. The first part of the book covers several different topics.  Grohl discusses his daughter Harper's interest in learning to play the drums, his own memories of going to Jazz clubs as a child with his mother, drum  lessons from Lenny Robinson, and his daughter Violet's first musical performance.  He recalls his first romantic heartbreak, he remembers getting hit in the head with a golf club as a child, breaking his leg after stage diving during a show, the influence of his ‚Äúultra-cool‚Äù cousin Tracey, and his habit of playing percussion with his teeth. The second part continues with memories of Grohl's early music years.  He covers the influence of the punk band Scream, his decision to drop out of school, early days on tour with Scream, meeting and playing with Iggy Pop, adventures in Amsterdam, and joining Nirvana.  He remembers the early days with Nirvana, playing Saturday Night Live and breaking a drum stick, and the feeling of the three members of the band slowly drifting apart... Part three has chapters that discuss Kurt Cobain‚Äôs death, the death of Grohl's friend Jimmy Swanson, playing with Tom Petty, early Foo Fighters memories, and the birth of his daughter. .  In part four Grohl covers talking to President Bush, psychics and dreams, going to jail in Australia, the birth of his daughter Harper, an intense workload, meeting the Obamas, having chest pains, and meeting other music icons like Paul McCartney and Elton John. In part five Grohl covers some of his later experiences, including his daughters' conversation with Joan Jett, a commitment to a daddy-daughter dance, the musical ability of his daughter Violet, and flashes of  some of the most pivotal events in his life. Overall I enjoyed reading this book.  I was impressed with Grohl's writing style, and he includes so many wild and hilarious stories about his life.  I also appreciated all of the pictures that he includes throughout the book, as they show what he looked like during the time periods that he is describing.  I think that fans of Grohl's will really enjoy this book, and even if you aren't familiar with his work at all, you can still appreciate some of these incredible stories.","05 Oct 2021","","","Yes","C","5.0","The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music","https://www.amazon.com/Storyteller-Tales-Life-Music/product-reviews/B091WVM1JD/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Inspiration, heartfelt, relatable.","You wouldn't think a huge rock star/legend like Dave Grohl could write a book that you would read and nod your head to on every page turn, but Dave wasn't born into stardom.  He grew up just like most of us in GenX and his stories are relatable because we've all been there.  His take on life and what matters to him is inspirational and I have to think it's a big reason for his success.  It's not what drove him (except to shove it in Sandy's face, and we all have had that dream growing up), but the passion for music and life.  The best guitar is not the pristine one in the case but the worn one that has a story to tell because it was used in life.  Dave is very much on his way to being the used guitar with the patina, but that's the one I would want in my collection every day because it outshines the one in the case in ways that aren't so obvious.  Thanks for writing this story and I look forward to following all your next set of adventures in life!  Thank you too for giving us all years of joy and emotion through your music.  You make life worth getting out of bed for and living as we all write new pages in our own books with your tunes featuring prominently in the soundtrack of our lives.","06 Oct 2021","","","Yes","Isaac Martinez","5.0","The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music","https://www.amazon.com/Storyteller-Tales-Life-Music/product-reviews/B091WVM1JD/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Truly a storyteller...","So I may have a little thing for rock musician biographies. I‚Äôm kind of fascinated by their lives and inspirations, what moves them and influences their music‚Ä¶ and there‚Äôs one memoir in particular I‚Äôve been hoping to read for what seems like forever. Dave Grohl‚Äôs The Storyteller. I am a HUGE fan, and have been since the very first time I heard ‚ÄúSmells Like Teen Spirit‚Äù on MTV. And yes, I may have preordered ‚ÄúThe Storyteller‚Äù before I finished reading the press release announcing it. So you might think that my review is a little bit prejudiced -- but truthfully, he has earned every one of these stars with this well-written, completely absorbing memoir. You‚Äôll cheer for him as he realizes his dream of becoming a touring musician, cry with him as he loses friends, family, and bandmates, and share his wonder at the incredibly blessed life he has led. The Storyteller is jam-packed with non-stop story after incredible story, and yet will still leave you wanting more and more‚Ä¶ just like a great Foo Fighters concert. Don‚Äôt miss it! ‚ÄúSomeday I‚Äôll have to tell you the rest.‚Äù Oh, Dave‚Ä¶ Trust me, we‚Äôre going to hold you to that promise. üòâ","07 Oct 2021","","","Yes","Tracy","5.0","The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music","https://www.amazon.com/Storyteller-Tales-Life-Music/product-reviews/B091WVM1JD/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Great read but . . .","The other five-star reviews capture the eloquence, energy, and passion Dave Grohl leaves on the pages of this eminently readable memoir. I really couldn‚Äôt put it down, which is saying something for me as I don‚Äôt usually find biographies and autobiographies to be page-turners. Also, I really enjoyed his stories about his kids and his tributes to his mother. Loved it! But I want to mention something that, for me, was a big missing piece, which was a description of the beginning of putting the Foo Fighters band together. Dave leaps from the intermission between the end of Nirvana to suddenly the release of FFs‚Äô second album and world tour. How did FF come together? He mentions the band members at the end, almost as a tribute (which moved my review from a 4- to a 5-star), but I really wanted more insight into the origins of the Foo Fighters. I guess that‚Äôs my own personal obsession, and shouldn‚Äôt  distract from the joy of reading this wonderful memoir. Congrats, Dave. It‚Äôs a great read. If this rock star thing doesn‚Äôt work out, you have a career as a writer.","18 Oct 2021","","","Yes","CGB","5.0","The Storyteller: Tales of Life and Music","https://www.amazon.com/Storyteller-Tales-Life-Music/product-reviews/B091WVM1JD/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I‚Äôm only on page 50 and not sure I can muscle through the rest. I thoroughly enjoyed his interview with Howard Stern and his storytelling is far better when he breathes life into it through his verbal words rather than his written ones.

"The book is 5 stars, it is so lovely.","Of course, I have only just started it, but it is a wonderful way to relate Paul‚Äôs life story.  The songs are spurring the memories.

The insights into his upbringing and Post World War II London help to understand how Paul views the world and his craft.

"Carry that Weight, Paul- You were a Beatle","This is a very different look back at Paul‚Äôs songs than I expected. Some of the Beatle‚Äôs big hits are represented, but there are many more obscure songs represented in these volumes like ‚ÄúEat at Home‚Äù, ‚ÄúCook of the House‚Äù,‚ÄùOn my Way to Work‚Äù, etc. It feels as if the Beatles era of Paul‚Äôs work is underplayed and under represented. This holds true for the photos as well. When I skimmed the volumes, it felt very post Beatles. It was actually difficult to find Beatles photos. We all understand that Paul was much more than a Beatle, but it was during that period of his life that he wrote his greatest  and most well known songs, whether he likes it or not and that is his audiences primary interest as well. It seems that in the space of 960 pages, all of his well known Beatles songs should have been covered. I‚Äôm disappointed- this is the closest we will come to a McCartney memoir and it just doesn‚Äôt deliver. I‚Äôm sad for the sake of history, after all, Paul is undeniably, one of the greatest songwriters of all time and this is what we‚Äôre left with. I can understand now why the price of this title is dropping. This will not satisfy most Paul McCartney fans.

"Lyrics is a full body experience","I‚Äôm going to start my review now having only gotten to Blackbird in the alphabetically arranged autobiographical presentation of Paul McCartneys music. Why, because this is a journey a magical mystery tour of experience through one of the most notable, poetic minds of our time. I‚Äôll never forget when Chris Rock said, I wanted to Be a Beatle! That one statement captures the utter and overwhelming universality of this phenomenon called the Beatles. They changed the world and McCartney was at its heart. It is the unselfish collaboration of Lennon and McCartney that brands so many melodies and the balance of Harrison, Starkey, that transformed John, Paul, George and Ringo into household names and timeless legends. I am reading the book start to finish and listening to each song while reading the lyrics anew in Amazon Music. Seeing and hearing the music in the context of McCartney‚Äôs history brings a whole new insight and appreciation for everything they did.

"Content is 5 stars plus! Printing is not","I adore the content of this book so much. For that I would give more than 5 stars!!! Tons of photos, behind the scenes content, content from many actors, fan art, etc. and much thicker than I thought it would be. The content is well worth the money. The print quality, particularly in the Season 1 section, was disappointing. Some photo pages were printed as if somehow the page slipped during printing, or the ink colors were not lined up. Luckily it didn‚Äôt permeate the entire book, only the Season 1 section. Hopefully my copy was an anomaly and others won‚Äôt have this experience.","26 Oct 2021","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713aEli-g2L._SY88.jpg

"A stunning series-specific bible that every Schitt's Creek fan needs","I preordered this book the instant it went up on Amazon, but before I even got my copy I saw Dan and Eugene Levy at the Beacon Theater in NYC hold a conversation about what went into the book and why. They discussed tons of tidbits (Dan even got Moira's missing baubles wrong from the first episode, saying they were bracelets, when the crowd reminded him they were earrings that she misplaced -- ""Don't *at* me!"" he said, hilariously). They anecdotally discussed content from the book while projecting it on-screen, telling the audience little tidbits (helped by fan accounts like Schittssheets on Instagram) with factoids like: 1. You never actually hear the swear word ""sh*t"" in the TV series. ""F***"" yes, but ""sh*t"" no. 2. Moira never utters the name of the town ""Schitt's Creek"" at any point during the show. 3. Eugene Levy rejected a scene which placed him on a beach shouting at the ocean in frustration. He didn't want depression to be a factor in his character. 4. When informed that they would continually add dark and preposterous wrinkles to Twyla's backstory, Sarah Levy simply asked --paraphrasing-- ""And I still need to say all of this while smiling?"" 5. The Johnny Rose-authored book 'Fast Forward To Success' features current-era Eugene Levy posing on the cover, but with a Photoshopped younger Eugene Levy head superimposed on the book jacket. Upon looking through the book itself (event-goers received a copy with their ticket, which was nice since I got to look through it before my Amazon copy arrived) they have heaps of fun details and sections like: 1. The Moiracabulary, which goes over every unique word that Moira uses during the show, such as Eugene Levy's favorite ""bombilate"" and Dan's favorite ""Dangersome."" 2. There's a map and guide to all of the misadventures that Alexis is described as getting into on the show, such as being kidnapped by Somali pirates from David Geffen's yacht. Eugene Levy described that only the best of the best of the elite get on David Geffen's yacht - ""The Kardashians haven't been on David Geffen's yacht."" 3. Fan art (but beautiful fan art) graces the book in places like The Crows Have Eyes 3 - The Crowening movie poster gallery. 4. A gallery of every outfit Moira wore during the series. 5. A gallery of Moira's wigs. 6. Intros written by every actor/character on the show on what it meant to them. 7. Massive amounts of behind the scenes details, like when Annie Murphy and Dan Levy found each other wandering through the sets on the final day of shooting, and just collapsed onto a couch and cried it out as the momentum stopped and the emotion caught up with them. 8. A gallery of fictional books conceived and designed to complement Fast Forward To Success on a bookshelf (the backstories for every character go super deep, so the writer's room would know how to write each character as the series progressed). This is not a casual coffee table book, filled with big pictures and pull quotes in large oversized fonts. This is a big book of substance for every Schitt's Creek fan out there, and is in my opinion indispensable if you consider yourself a fan of the show. I'll be keeping the copy I got at the live event, as well as the one I preordered on Amazon. The one I received at the show will be the one I pore over and thumb through in the upcoming years, or to pull as a reference while watching the show for further insight. My 2nd copy will remain on the shelf, in pristine condition forevermore, or until it is needed to gift to a future fan of the show.","26 Oct 2021","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/7121HrbIhJL._SY88.jpg

"Curl up in your jammies and enjoy the coze!","The media could not be loaded. Despite the delivery driver leaving this half hanging off my porch in the monsoon rains of the northeast, book getting slightly warped in the process, it is an absolute comforting read.  Grab a hot toddy, your jammies, and curl up on the couch as you head back to Schitt's Creek. The book itself is incredible to hold and look at.  It's very substantial and the quality is incredible.  The print, paper, and photos on the pages is top notch.  Then there are the stories.  An engaging read as we hear from so many actors and crew about their personal journies throughout the six seasons of this show. It's not just one author's voice, it's truly a townsful that make up the body of this book.  This gives it a well rounded, complete feel.  ""Fold in"" a generous helping of fan art and the book is truly elevated to a collectors item.  Add in pages of scripts, photo montages of all of David's sweaters and Moira's wigs and you will find yourself laughing out loud! This book is for any friend of the show. Even a die hard fan will find new tidbits to enjoy and pictures to treasure.  I know I plan to treasure mine for years to come.

Short format movie is obviously not the strength of Chase, er al, and a oral history is not just a transcript of previous spoken word instead of interviews..  A great example of an outstanding oral history is Bob Hoskin‚Äôs Led Zeppelin book, which gave lots of new stuff and told the same anecdotes from different POV.","05 Nov 2021","","","Yes","M.

"Fantastic book and a great read!","Wow, just received my copy of the book Woke Up This Morning, the Definitive History of The Sopranos. And it did not disappoint ! Amazing behind the scenes stories of how the show came into being and a lot of great juicy details. I learned a lot about the actors having been a huge fan of the show from the beginning. If you‚Äôve ever wanted to look behind the curtain of how one of the most iconic shows in history was made this book is it! The back and forth banter between Steve Schirripa and Michael Imperoili is hilarious! Not to mention the beautiful the intimate behind the scenes photos which are great! I‚Äôd definitely recommend it and give it 5 Stars! I‚Äôll be ordering additional copies as Christmas gifts to give out to my friends who are big fans of the show as well!","03 Nov 2021","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71L-R8+o8FL._SY88.jpg","Yes","L.

"Thoroughly enjoyable read that adds a whole new dimension to The Sopranos","The book is filled with backstory and information relating to the creation and filming of The Sopranos. I loved it for 3 reasons: 1. It adds a new dimension because the reader gains a new insight into the show by sharing the perspective of how the show was made, how it developed. 2. Complexities of the storyline and flashes of detail easily missed are highlighted and, let's face it, the narrative is very busy - even after watching the show 3 times I am finding things that I missed. 3. It isn't a summary of each episode - the book explores the development of the show from season to season, sure, but focuses on the themes and characters. A definite winner for anyone who likes, let alone loves, The Sopranos.","04 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Andrew Christie","5.0","Woke Up This Morning: The Definitive Oral History of The Sopranos","https://www.amazon.com/Woke-Up-This-Morning-Definitive/product-reviews/B097NQ1FPB/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"So so disappointed","Another deck I waited months for. I ordered April 7th and received them today! Only to open them with (great packaging btw) and have two cards bent. They won't last when shuffling. Cards are so so then and cheap material. Art and characters to the titles in the deck are perfect. But overall quality is NOT what it should be.

"Great for the collection, not so much for everyday use","I waited over a YEAR for this, and I'm stoked to finally have it in my hands. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful deck - the art style and characters assigned are (chef's kiss motion) BUT. Quality wise? Definitely more for show than a main deck to use. The cards are very thick, and weirdly textured yet slick? They aren't easy to shuffle. You can't easily slide shuffle them because they want to stick, and the stiffness prevents you from using the ""playing card"" shuffle method. I have a feeling if you aren't careful it'll be easy to put a perma bend or even scratch some of the design. Can't complain though, a big corporation hopping on the growing popularity of the occult? I was expecting worse honestly. The guidebook is actually not your vague cringey descriptor either - it's decent and worded in a very easy to understand (and learn!) way for what the card itself represents. While I do wish they didn't push the ""destiny"" portion I will applaud for it not being crudely overdone, and the most important word (to me) is used - insight. Just another nice way to talk to your reflection in the mirror and be provided something to stroke your thought process on an issue. Less ooga booga magic future and more practical. Love it. I'll probably use it occasionally for a reading, but TLDR: the material used doesn't give the cards a lasting lifetime of daily use On an entirely different topic - are yalls Hierophant cards also including that blatant misspell? I can't find it as a joke in zootopia so I think it's literally just. Something that happened lmfao (no fault to the illustrator, 78 designs is hard work!)","09 Nov 2021","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61goH5VdfvL._SY88.jpg","Yes","Debra Sneed","4.0","Disney Villains Tarot Deck and Guidebook | Movie Tarot Deck | Pop Culture Tarot","https://www.amazon.com/Disney-Villains-Tarot-Guidebook-Culture/product-reviews/1647221560/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Lots of missed opportunities","1. Art: beautiful, no complaints! 2. Card stock: I read reviews saying that it was crappy, cheap card stock. I‚Äôm actually happy with the card stock. I‚Äôve definitely had cheaper card stock on other decks. They are considerably thick yet flexible, with a matte finish. They don‚Äôt feel cheap like cardboard. 3. Imagery: some of the cards make so much sense (see pic #1). A lot of the cards just don‚Äôt (see pic #2). Lots of missed opportunities. Why have the gators from Rescuers on Strength, instead of Scar (the lion)? Why have villains from the Sword in the Stone (keyword SWORD), featured in the suit of Wands? For most of the deck, it seemed whoever put them together had very little working knowledge of the tarot, and just slapped random villains on random cards. Some villains are over-used (ie Scar, see pic #3), while others are left out all-together. 4. The deck probably won‚Äôt make sense for a beginner. Unlike the traditional Rider Waite, most of the minor arcana (see pic #4) don‚Äôt have images to help the reader interpret the meaning. They kept the minor super simple, another missed opportunity. I think they could have done SO MUCH with this deck. I hope they come out with another one that isn‚Äôt JUST villains, but utilizes a variety of characters. The idea with villains is cool, but limiting. And I hope they assign someone with knowledge of the tarot to the task!","12 Nov 2021","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-K5W7GEkL._SY88.jpg

They have dent lines running through the images. Another reviewer had the same issue. Also, the card stock is pretty cheap, and the cards don't feel like they'll shuffle well.

First deck I have gotten with that feature and its much appreciated! Features many villains even from lesser-known and older movies like the rescuers! Loved finding and remembering so many iconic villains. Only villain that comes to mind who was missing is frollo and I understand why they wouldn't have included him.

"very highly recommended collection of gorgeous photographs","National Geographic Photo Ark Wonders: Celebrating Diversity in the Animal Kingdom by Joel Sartore is a very highly recommended collection of gorgeous photographs from the animal kingdom. During his long career, Joel Sartore set out to photograph every kind of creature. He has now amazingly captured the images of more than 11,000 of 20,000 species across the world. In this latest collection he shares 462 of his photographs, in one or two page spreads. Each photograph has the scientifically accurate name along with interesting information and/or distinctive features. Sartore also recalls interesting stories and adventures resulting from his photographic journeys. A great example of what you can find in this latest edition of National Geographic Photo Ark Wonders is on 100-101. The photograph is of the Egyptian fruit bat, Rousettus aegyptiacus(LC). ""Roosting by the dozens or the thousands, these bats are found across Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Eastern Mediterranean to northern India. After breeding season, females gather in nursing colonies to give birth to and rear their pups, while males form bachelor colonies elsewhere."" On the page is also the story about an incident of ""wet contact"" Sartore experienced while taking photographs that could have potentially resulted in being infected with the Marburg virus. Thankfully, after quarantining for 3 weeks, there was no sign of infection. The collection is broadly presented in four chapters: Pattern, Shape, Extra, and Attitude. As mentioned, most of the pages are of single animals but along with individual photographs there are several pages that feature collections of a similar group. These include mice, caterpillars, snakes, beetles, crabs, sea urchins, scorpions, snakes, parrots, and others. There are also unique pairings  such as a Western screech owl (pg. 358) and an Ocelot (pg. 359) both winking and a hippopotamus (pg. 330) and a Northern Luzon cloud rat (pg. 331) who both have their mouths wide open. The index of animals at the back are listed by the page on which they appear, with the listed divided by the chapter name. I tried to pick out a few individual pictures that I loved, but it was simple too difficult to pair the list down. (In the running: The Sand Cat, pg 4-5; Barred eagle-owl, pg 48; veiled chameleon tail, pg 119; Brazilian Porcupine, pg. 249; and the Proboscis monkey, pg. 253.) Previous photo ark collections include: National Geographic Photo Ark, Birds of the Photo Ark, and Photo Ark Vanishing. National Geographic Photo Ark Wonders: Celebrating Diversity in the Animal Kingdom would make a wonderful, thoughtful gift.

"Amazing Photos","National Geographic Photo Ark Wonders: Celebrating Diversity in the Animal Kingdom by Joel Sartore is a coffee table book highlighting animals, and nature. Mr. Sartore is an award-winning photographer and conservationist. Like many other National Geographic books, this one is a gorgeous volume with especially fantastic photography. National Geographic Photo Ark Wonders: Celebrating Diversity in the Animal Kingdom by Joel Sartore showcases the author‚Äôs collection of amazing images. The book, in particular, represents a broad collection of art. The collection is divided into four distinct chapters: Pattern, Shape, Extra, and Attitude. Shape is concerned with ‚Äúgraceful curves or sharp projectiles‚Äù. The chapter generally features many animals, from flamingos to craps, giraffes to a giant jumping stick. The photos are unlike I‚Äôve ever seen and certainly makes one appreciate animals for all their fright and glory. Pattern showcases spots, stripes, and colors. Of course, birds immediately come to mind, and they do get a fair amount of space. However, some animals which you wouldn‚Äôt associate with the chapter are also featured, such as seahorses, millipedes, and even certain eggs. Extra tells of ‚Äúteeth and tails, whiskers and antlers‚Äù. Surprisingly, this was a most fascinating chapter because you rarely see, not to mention think of. I enjoyed the placement of the photos, species of animals you would think have nothing in common all of the sudden seem to be distant relatives. If Extra was the most fascinating, Attitude was a family favorite. This chapter specifically showcases anthropotheism, assigning human characteristics to animals. While we all know this to be, most likely, not the case it is, nevertheless, entertaining. I have no clue how Mr. Sartore got these photographs, but that‚Äôs, indeed, why he has a book and I don‚Äôt. The book is undeniably a fascinating look into the animal kingdom in all its glory and majesty.","21 Oct 2021","","","Yes","Man of La Book","5.0","National Geographic Photo Ark Wonders: Celebrating Diversity in the Animal Kingdom","https://www.amazon.com/National-Geographic-Photo-Ark-Wonders/product-reviews/1426221916/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

He travels the world photographing animals for his books and records their splendor while they‚Äôre still available to model for him.  His photography is exquisite and he is able to capture unique features and even characteristics of his subjects.  From doe eyes to feathers, scales, and fur, these photos are a delight to page through.  Sometimes they pose with great theatricality (looking at you Von der Decken‚Äôs safika) and occasionally Sartore provides a humorous anecdote in the captions.

"The Definitive Led Zeppelin Biography Available","First, I‚Äôve read just about every book there is on Zep. They‚Äôve been my favorite band since I saw them in Seattle ‚Äò77 (yeah, I know, it‚Äôs too bad I wasn‚Äôt able to see them in LA 3 weeks earlier, let alone on all their earlier tours but hey, I wasn‚Äôt born until 1960 and, I lived in the Pacific Northwest). Second, there have been a ton of excellent books on Zeppelin over the years, the most recent being ‚ÄúEvenings With Led Zeppelin: The Complete Concert Chronicle‚Äù by Dave Lewis, which I reviewed as well. I even have the bootleg books covered (e.g. Luis Rey‚Äôs ‚ÄúLed Zeppelin Live: An Illustrated Exploration of Underground Tapes‚Äù is the all-time classic but, Robert Godwin‚Äôs CD shaped book from the 90‚Äôs was memorable as well). Then there are the fanzines, with ‚ÄúProximity‚Äù (I own the complete set) and ‚ÄúTight but Loose,‚Äù both of which were/are top-of-the-line and full of great info. So‚Ä¶why would I want to read yet another book on the greatest band of the 70‚Äôs? The reason is this book‚Äôs author ‚Äî Bob Spitz. As many books as there are on The Beatles, his widely-respected biography of them stands out, in my mind, as the overall best. Based on that alone, I immediately bought this latest look at Zeppelin‚Äôs musical history, and I have not been disappointed. Spitz combines serious literary chops and thorough research with an in-depth and balanced look at the band‚Äôs highlights‚Ä¶and lowlights. As one might suspect, there are some classic photographs included in the book too; ‚ÄúRobert celebrating the de-pantsing of Phil Carson‚Äù is probably my favorite. Ah, those were the days! On the whole, I have found this new biography to be the best of the many that have been published over the years (my first was Ritchie Yorke‚Äôs book that came out way back in ‚Äò75!). Whether you are new to Led Zeppelin, or a life-long fan like me who knows their incredible story very well, this book offers the most comprehensive view of the greatest live band ever (and they weren‚Äôt too darn shabby in the studio either!). Sincere kudos to the author on a job well done‚Ä¶I highly recommend this!","09 Nov 2021","","","Yes","PW108","5.0","Led Zeppelin: The Biography","https://www.amazon.com/Led-Zeppelin-Biography-Bob-Spitz-ebook/product-reviews/B08XTLJCZ7/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Disappointed","I've just received my copy of the book. I headed to the photo sections immediately and noticed right off the bat that many of the pictures included have incorrect dates attributed to them. Photos taken in Oakland, 1977 are mistakenly listed by the author as taken in 1979. A famous pic of Jimmy in his storm trooper garb from Chicago 1977 is listed as 1975...I'll not bore anyone with all the other glaring errors just in the photo sections alone, but this is NOT a good sign. As a mega Zep fan for 40 yrs, how can I take this book seriously when it's already loaded with BS before I've even picked it up to read it?! Are we to assume that the rest of this book is full of innacuracies as well? I think so. Though I may waste my time reading the whole thing at some point, I'm really put off by multiple errors already for things this author could have so easily looked up. These are lazy mistakes, and this author's credibility is now in the toilet. **To say that there is a plethora of misinformation out there regarding Led Zeppelin is a gross understatement.** The internet has become a stinking cesspool of false information - especially on this band in particular - and here we have yet another new book to add to a VERY LONG line of others that include fake ""myths"" and innacuracies (yeah, I'm looking at YOU, 'Hammer of the Gods' and 'Stairway To Heaven'). Zeppelin fans know better and deserve much more than...well, more of the same. * if somehow this book is mostly accurate with LZ history, I will edit my comment here and happily praise this author.","11 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Marilyn","3.0","Led Zeppelin: The Biography","https://www.amazon.com/Led-Zeppelin-Biography-Bob-Spitz-ebook/product-reviews/B08XTLJCZ7/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"You will waste your money!","I own many coloring books and this is the worst quality book I've ever bought!!! So disappointed that I want to return it. This is a prime example of needing to wait til I can see videos of a flip thru before purchasing. Where to even begin? This book is very over priced for the quality. Isn't even worth 5.00. Every single picture is cut off in the binding along with the top/bottom and outer edging. Every single Xmas tree is cut out of the pictures. You will only have a quarter to one half to color. The images were never sized to fit the paper. It feels like they rushed to create then print to get to market. The quality is nothing like her other books, this is simply an embarrassment of a book. Word has it she wouldn't be doing anymore so if this is what we get then no thank you! I don't mean to sound harsh but these pics should have never gone to print. Image sizing is even bad. Santa is smaller than the ornaments in one pic. This artist cannot draw people and the face of one caroler is indescribably terrible. In a living room setting the chairs are too big for the rest of the images. Pictures themselves aren't even that cute. Save yourself the trouble and pass on this.

"Compulsively readable‚Ä¶","There seem to be more books written about the movie ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù and its sequels than any other movie ever made, with the possible exception of ‚ÄúGone With the Wind‚Äù. And I‚Äôve read many/most of them!  But so far, the best one I‚Äôve read is the recently published ‚ÄúLeave the Gun, Take the Cannoli - The Epic Story of the Making of ‚ÄúThe Godfather‚Äù, by Mark Seal. Mark Seal has put together/written an extremely readable history of everything having to do with the book and movie. He looks into the rather diverse crew who financed, acted, produced, and wrote the movie, beginning with the author, Mario Puzo. Other ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù like Robert Evans and Charles Bluhdorn are also included, as well as people protesting the making of the movie. Seal takes the reader back to the late 1960‚Äôs/early 1970‚Äôs when the movie industry was being rocked by societal changes. He has included things about the movie from primary sources I haven‚Äôt read.anywhere else. He‚Äôs written an almost compulsively readable book.","21 Oct 2021","","","Yes","gammyjill","5.0","Leave the Gun, Take the Cannoli: The Epic Story of the Making of The Godfather","https://www.amazon.com/Leave-Gun-Take-Cannoli-Godfather/product-reviews/198215859X/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Riveting","I love to read what went on behind the scenes of favorite movies (and other events of interest to me) and this book tells you everything that happened behind the filming of The Godfather and tells it beautifully. A real page-turner. I won't insert spoilers here. Suffice it to say this was a more than satisfying read and kept me content in my insomnia for several nights. My only criticism, and it's so mild I'm not letting it effect my 5-star review, is that I feel the insertion of pages of literal conversation in the center of the book between Coppola and others regarding filming certain scenes--when the conversation was uninteresting (to me) and prosaic--interrupted the flow of an otherwise perfect book. I would've preferred the continuation of the writer's narrative and his lively summary of those conversations. I rarely buy Kindle books at full price, but I paid the full price of this one and am without regret. I'd read anything else the author wrote.","23 Oct 2021","","","Yes","Francie Nolan","5.0","Leave the Gun, Take the Cannoli: The Epic Story of the Making of The Godfather","https://www.amazon.com/Leave-Gun-Take-Cannoli-Godfather/product-reviews/198215859X/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"A fast-paced romp through movie history","Many years ago, I read Mark Seal's 2009 Vanity Fair article, ""The Godfather Wars,"" upon which much of ""Leave the Gun, Take the Cannoli"" is built. From it sprang a deeper interest in the making of the movie, and having now read a considerable amount of literature on 'The Godfather,' I can -- with confidence -- say that this book is one of the better, if not the best, pieces of journalism on the subject. Seal leaves no stone unturned as he unpacks the circumstances surrounding the movie's creation, using interviews with most of the key players (including Al Pacino, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo's family, among dozens of others) to unwrap a narrative that is, at this point, almost as mythological as the movie itself. One point of criticism. In the middle of the book we get a fairly long chapter that reads like a transcript of Coppola's production meetings, likely culled from the notes that Seal was provided by the stenographer who served as a fly on the wall during the making of the movie. I liked it, because it provided insight into Coppola and his creative team's thinking at the time, but its execution -- almost like an intermission -- felt at odds with the rest of the book. All in all, worth the money and the time you'll spend reading it.","11 Nov 2021","","","Yes","paul cantor","5.0","Leave the Gun, Take the Cannoli: The Epic Story of the Making of The Godfather","https://www.amazon.com/Leave-Gun-Take-Cannoli-Godfather/product-reviews/198215859X/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Fascinating Reveals Of An Iconic Movie","Leave The Gun, Take The Cannoli: The Epic Story of the Making of The Godfather by journalist Mark Seal is a riveting tale of  dysfunctional Hollywood, real mobster violence, a brilliant director and actors so talented that even the distractions of many egos and budget confinements could not keep their brilliance from shining through all the BS. It may be 50 years since the ultimate mob movie The Godfather graced theater screens but we still refer to it whether we jokingly (or not) say phrases like ""I am going to make him an offer he can't refuse"" or don't give him the ""kiss of death."" Poor Fredo (Spoiler Alert)! One of the most iconic scenes is after a murder in a car the killer is told, ""Leave the Gun, Take the Cannoli."" His wife told him not to forget the dessert on his way home from work that night. It was a complete ad lib! Besides fascinating reveals narrator Phil Thron gave me chills when reading the transformation the crew witnessed when Marlon Brando quietly sat down, put cotton balls in his cheeks, drew a mustache and quietly uttered his first words as Vito Corleone and changed the course of not only his career but Fancis Ford Coppola, Al Pacino, Diane Jeaton, James Caan and even, eventually Robert Dinero's in The Godfather II. I was also pleasantly surprised that the author of The Godfather, Mario Puzo is from my neighborhood of Bay Shore, Long Island. Whether you are a movie buff, a fan of actors and actresses, authors, mob stories or directors this story is a compelling take that, ironically, would make a thrilling movie. I received a free copy of this audiobook from the publisher for a fair and honest review. All opinions are my own.","25 Oct 2021","","","Yes","Linda McCutcheon","5.0","Leave the Gun, Take the Cannoli: The Epic Story of the Making of The Godfather","https://www.amazon.com/Leave-Gun-Take-Cannoli-Godfather/product-reviews/198215859X/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Fantastic read!","If you can recount any sort of punk rock glory days, you can probably also recall the constant ""sellout tightrope"" your favorite band must have tried to walk- how to get their music heard and fill venues without appearing to compromise their values? This book tells the story of several different bands who tried to make the jump from indie to ""sellout"", and details how that worked out for them. Spoiler: it didn't, often. This book is fascinating even if you aren't familiar with all of the bands included, and if you're a fan of any of them, you'll learn something new. I am a hardcore Green Day/Lookout Records nerd going way back and was aware of what Green Day went through when they left Lookout, but there was a lot detailed here that I didn't know. I came away from reading Jawbreaker's part with an even stronger sense of loss for what might have been- the greatest band the world doesn't (but should) know. If you're a person who enjoys highly detailed, well-written accounts of what goes on behind the scenes when major labels try to make money gambling on what will be The Next Big Thing, you'll really enjoy this deep dive.","11 Nov 2021","","","Yes","ItsJess","5.0","Sellout: The Major-Label Feeding Frenzy That Swept Punk, Emo, and Hardcore (1994‚Äì2007)","https://www.amazon.com/Sellout-Feeding-Frenzy-Hardcore-1994-2007/product-reviews/0358244307/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Behind the mohawks, the music, and the pit","Loud galloping guitars‚Ä¶ thumping bass‚Ä¶ chest-hammering drums‚Ä¶ soaring vocals. The pop punk surge blasted out of my college dorm window. Dookie. Enema of the State. 24 Hour Revenge Therapy. These albums were part of the soundtrack of my young life‚Ä¶ uh yeah, I still listen to them! Dan Ozzi‚Äôs book Sellout tells the story of these bands‚Ä¶ from small-town formation to big-city tours and major-label signings. I loved every minute of the basement rehearsals and especially the back and forth about: What exactly is Punk? What is selling out? What is this post-grunge rebel music going to sound like and who will produce and sell these songs? Reacting to the wild success of Nirvana, the major labels saw dollar signs on the faces of these young punk, but many didn‚Äôt see eye to eye with these stuffed shirts. They thought that the signature on the dotted line meant that authenticity would be thrown out the window and over-production would ruin the raw sound‚Ä¶ The answer: Some bands could have given a shit‚Ä¶ and for some, signing ruined everything. There was great pressure to put out the absolute best album for your major label debut. These story lines set up a fascinating look at the music industry. In many ways my angsty friend and I were only witness to the end result: the album and the rock show, but so much goes on behind the scenes and this is that story. Interviews with all the major players: the musicians, the hit makers, the reporters, and the fans. A complete piece of journalism that digs into all the whys and hows of the 90s and 00s music scene. Sellout is the story of 11 bands on the precipice of their indie career‚Ä¶ Will they or won‚Äôt they ‚Äúsellout?‚Äù I loved it. If you ever entered the mosh pit, pumped your fist to ‚ÄúAm I just paranoid/ Or am I just stoned?,‚Äù or ran to Tower Records looking for the latest emo sound, Get this book! 5 out of 5 stars.","26 Oct 2021","","","Yes","Paul C","5.0","Sellout: The Major-Label Feeding Frenzy That Swept Punk, Emo, and Hardcore (1994‚Äì2007)","https://www.amazon.com/Sellout-Feeding-Frenzy-Hardcore-1994-2007/product-reviews/0358244307/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"From someone who is in the book ... its spot on","If you loved punk and emo in the late 90s / early 2000s, you‚Äôll love reliving some of your fave moments while getting an accounting of what happened behind the scenes. I was Thursday's manager during most of the period recounted in the book and these stories are truly representative of what took place. I do wish they had published the story about the time I ran into Tony Brummel after the deals were done with Island. We were at a Taking Back Sunday show in NYC. It had been so long since he had seen me face to face that I think he may have forgotten what I looked like. Not sure. But I went up to him and tried to hug him. I truly wanted to thank him for all the good things that had come out of our work together with Thursday. He wasn't into it and or thought I was mocking him because after I chased him around and several times to give him that hug, he ran out of the venue before the band ever played. Oh well. Based on what he had to say in the book, he might still *NEED* a hug! Buy the book. You'll really enjoy going deep on all these bands. PS.

"Amazing set, not at all like the ""Art of"" series","First, let me say this is a gorgeous product.  The two volumes are fabric-bound hardcovers with a gold embossed image on the front of each (Iron Man on the first, the Infinity Gauntlet on the second).  The pages are thick, high quality paper, and the color and images are beautiful.  Each volume is about 250 pages, and they are quite heavy! I collect the ""Art of..."" Marvel hardcovers, and I worried that this book would basically be a conglomerate of all of those.  That's not what this is at all.  The art books focus on development and concept designs.  These volumes are much more focused on production.  There are many, many behind the scene photos to show you how they filmed different shots in the movies (Tony Start in the donut, Vision flying, the circle up in Avengers, to name a very few examples). There are a LOT of photos in this book, but there are also a lot of words!  Snippets from different interviews with cast and crew are scattered among the pages.  Ever wonder how Don Cheadle reacted when he found out Rhodey would be paralyzed?  This book will tell you. Something worth noting is that this book is broken down by year rather than by film.  The first volume covers the inspiration for and creation of Marvel Studios up through 2014; the second covers 2015 through 2019 with an additional chapter titled ""The Future.""  This means that all the content from any given movie cannot be found in one place; while you read about filming Ragnarok, they will talk about casting Captain Marvel, then jump to some info on Black Panther, then bring you back to Ragnarok in the next chapter.  It flows really well because this book is about movie production, not the individual movies themselves. All together, I highly recommend this book if you love the Marvel movies or are interested in how they are filmed.  It's a high quality set that's perfect for collectors.","20 Oct 2021","","","Yes","J.

"An excellent trove of information, poorly executed.","Let me preface by saying I order this book set three years ago, so my expectations were extremely high after years of delay. On the surface this is a beautiful book set with a lovely slipcase and two beautifully bound books, full of excellent photographs. But the text is atrocious. There are sentences repeated from one page to the next, stray words repeated, and entire sentences started  on one page and incomplete on the next. Amateur at best for a retail price of $150 (having ordered so early I paid far less). So 5 stars for the photos and info, 1 star for the hacks who organized and executed.","29 Oct 2021","","","Yes","A. pierce","3.0","The Story of Marvel Studios: The Making of the Marvel Cinematic Universe","https://www.amazon.com/Marvel-Studios-Definitive-Behind-Blockbuster/product-reviews/1419732447/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Great for Marvel fan, if a bit overpriced","First of all, I commend the publisher for packaging this book in its own manufacturer box. Even so, it took three tries to get a minimally dented book, since the second time Amazon sent me what must have been someone's return without the manufacturer box. I remember a few years back when this book's product page first appeared and the MSRP was $135, I think, (now inflated to $150), then stayed at $90 for quite some time, not only on Amazon but on B&N, etc. So if you like the book but are holding back due to the price, it is likely that the price will go lower (the Art of Marvel Studios box set hung out at around $60 for some time, also with an MSRP of $150). As for the presentation, while it does look nice as a whole, the quality doesn't exactly bear closer examination - a slight ripple in the artwork on the box cover, a spot of glue on the cloth, and as someone else mentioned, not the best binding. As a fan of earlier MCU films (and RDJ in particular), I've had this book on my wish-list for a while for the behind the scenes info and cast/crew interviews, information that probably won't be collected elsewhere, so I've decided to splurge on this :)","30 Oct 2021","","","Yes","H.L.","4.0","The Story of Marvel Studios: The Making of the Marvel Cinematic Universe","https://www.amazon.com/Marvel-Studios-Definitive-Behind-Blockbuster/product-reviews/1419732447/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Excellent","This is the most comprehensive guide to everything pre-MCU, the filming of every single movie of the Infinity Saga, the impact of the MCU, and what's to come in the future for Marvel, not just in terms of movies. The set photos are top-notch, the concept art is so good, and the chapters are organized by year so you can jump around easily to find what you want. Worth the buy. Two minor issues I have is that the binding feels a little weak cause of how heavy the pages are, but personally, it's really not a big deal. These books are more or less meant for display most of the time anyway. Also, the front and back covers feel a bit thin, but that just might be because of the cloth-woven type feel they were going for.","21 Oct 2021","","","Yes","Henry","5.0","The Story of Marvel Studios: The Making of the Marvel Cinematic Universe","https://www.amazon.com/Marvel-Studios-Definitive-Behind-Blockbuster/product-reviews/1419732447/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"A must-have for any diehard MCU fan","This two-volume set is a comprehensive and insightful dive into the Marvel film franchise, covering each film's conception from vision to reception, ranging from 2008's Iron Man to Spider-Man: Far From Home in 2019. There are even touching mentions of earlier Marvel films like the animated productions, Blade, and Ang Lee's Hulk. Everything is covered with deep affection and disarming honesty, and the films' creators are forthcoming about why some details didn't work so well, but mostly why we consider these films to be a part of the greatest cinematic success stories in existence today. Most of all, creators and artists who are hungry for knowledge about how to deliver compelling storytelling that's informed by great design will appreciate the in-depth look at the creative process, and how to turn challenges into opportunities. It's a textbook for how to turn comic book fans into film buffs and film buffs into comic book fans. It's also a treatise on passion projects that draw us all in. It makes the case for allowing nerds to run artistic mediums that handle the material they're nerdy about. It's a magnificently assembled (excuse the term) compilation of the movies that have been keeping us coming back to the darkened auditoriums and bright screens for 10 years, even through a pandemic. In addition, it looks gorgeous on the shelf and is built to last. If you're a Marvel fan, a moviegoer, or an artist needing inspiration, this is for you. Don't miss it.","23 Oct 2021","","","Yes","B.

"Casually presented, well-illustrated brief history of magic","Considerable scholarship underlies the historical presentation here, despite the absence of in-text footnotes, as you can see at the end of the book from the suggested readings, and chapter-by-chapter discussions of the documentary origins of the material presented within each chapter.  But what the book actually is, rather than a history, is a look at some of the holdings of David Copperfield's museum of magic.  It incorporates two large private collections, of Dr. Robert Albo and magician John Mulholland, plus innumerable props, costumes and posters associated with famous magicians over the years, assembled by David Copperfield.  A close duplicate of the showroom of the clothing store once owned by David's father serves as the entrance to the museum, which is not open to the public.  Inside is a full-scale replica of the show room of Tannen's magic shop in NYC, and of the famous theater connected with Martinka's magic store.  The photographs are by the long-time associate director of David's TV specials, and they do an excellent job of using the available lighting of the exhibits within the museum.  Co-authors are Richard Wiseman, a famous British psychologist and magician, and David Britland.  The book might not be selling well, as Amazon has already sharply discounted it.  However, if you are a magician, or are interested in the art of magic, this volume is a must for your library!","08 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Rory Coker","3.0","David Copperfield's History of Magic","https://www.amazon.com/David-Copperfields-History-Magic-Copperfield/product-reviews/1982112913/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"A History of Magicians not Magic","I was expecting a history of Magic not one devoted to magicians, good and bad.  Virtually no explanation is given of any magic tricks nor how they evolved.

"The History of Magic Matters, Learn Why!","David Copperfield's History of Magic is a journey into David's World of Magic. His enormous collection of historical magic is lovingly shared in breathtaking photos and informative text throughout the book. The photos taken by a magical artist in his own right Homer Liwag. Every single photo is a work of art. The book begins with what I believe are the two most perfect words for a book of this nature. Two simple words, ""Magic Matters."" As historians we know it. As performers we know it. As fans of magic we know it. And in this crazy world we live in, it's time we let others know and remind those of us who have forgotten, Magic Matters! There are 28 Chapters in this book and they are basically in chronological order. The first being a chapter about the first english language magic book, Reginald Scot's Discovery of Witchcraft of 1584. Next we have a chapter on Robert-Houdin the Father of Modern Magic. The images included in that chapter show the Pastry Chef of the Palais Royale, numerous posters, cornucopias used to produce items in the show, and numerous Houdin Mystery Clocks. The chapter covers a brief history of Robert Houdin and it wonderfully illustrates the importance of Houdin in the history of our art. Chapter 9 focuses on the Queen of Magic, Adelaide Herrmann. She was one of the first female magicians and she was quite famous in her day. Adelaide was the wife of the Great Herrmann, who died while on tour. She took over the show and proved to be an artist in her own right. On Sept 7th, 1926, the warehouse where Adelaide Herrmann was storing her show, burned to the ground. All was lost. So the fact that there are still items of hers to view is astonishing! Chapter 14-HOUDINI. The most famous magician of all time. Here we find many of the props and illusions that Houdini used in his career. As David Copperfield has said in numerous interviews, ""If Houdini were alive today, he would see his whole show right here."" ¬†That's pretty accurate. At least, the main pieces. Much of the Houdini show has been lost to time. Yet, there are items here that have never been in a collection until now. Houdini's bathtub, straight out of his home in NYC, and his bookshelf also from his home in NYC. The way the bookshelf has been set up allows a visiter to get a photo recreation of one that Houdini himself took oh so many years ago. I could go on and on about each chapter of the book, but I am going to stop here. Let me just say that each chapter contains several photos and a fine overview of the life of the performer being discussed. As a magic historian, I would have preferred longer chapters, but this is a book for the public and I believe those chapters are exactly the right length. Also, thankfully, this IS a book for the general public, because of that, it means we are not paying hundreds of dollars for the book. It is worth hundreds of dollars easily. Every category of magic is covered in this book: The Manipulators, The Close-up Performer, The Mentalist, The Stage Performer, the Comedy Performer, the Illusionist, the Escape Artist and more. If this were just a history of magic, it would be great to have these various images and stories in one place. But knowing that this is all together in one collection, that makes it all even more special. Let me end with this. If you have not ordered a copy of the book, please do so. Do yourself a favor and get this book. Use it to learn about the history of our cherished art. Use it for inspiration. Use it to understand that, as David Copperfield said at the beginning of the book, Magic Matters!","05 Nov 2021","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61eaFnKC65L._SY88.jpg","Yes","Dean Carnegie","5.0","David Copperfield's History of Magic","https://www.amazon.com/David-Copperfields-History-Magic-Copperfield/product-reviews/1982112913/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Early review","I have been a fan of Copperfield since I was a kid, and often heard about how he collected magic artifacts, so was super excited to discover a book was coming out on the subject. I just flipped through it when having received on release day, but felt compelled to leave a brief review.  Very high quality book (coffee table style), with great photographs of his historical collection.  The text is brief, and accompanies the photographs.

"Fascinating and terrific on audio as well","I was lucky enough to see David Copperfield's Las Vegas magic extravaganza about twenty years ago, it was such a fantastic show.  So when I saw this new book I knew I'd want to listen to it.  Somehow I thought this was a memoir and in a small part it is but, the book is so much more. David Copperfield, a New Jersey native, was a shy kid who at the age of ten asked his mother for a ventriloquist dummy -- so began his fascination with magic and illusion.  He was the youngest person ever to be accepted into the Society of Magicians. In this well researched book Copperfield along with fellow magicians Richard Wiseman and David Britland share the stories of some 28 magicians and illusionists, some dating back to the 16th century. The book is full of background on the early tricksters, magicians and illusionists and what they became famous for.  It was fascinating to learn how each of the magicians and illusionists seemed to inspire others to become passionate of their craft. Anyone who has had an interest or curiosity about magic should check this book out. I loved it.  The audio was read by David Copperfield and Fedor Chin who were both excellent and highly recommended. However, now I want to get a copy of the print version as I understand there are some 100+ photographs and objects from Copperfield's Museum of Magic.","26 Oct 2021","","","Yes","My 2 Cents","5.0","David Copperfield's History of Magic","https://www.amazon.com/David-Copperfields-History-Magic-Copperfield/product-reviews/1982112913/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"A beautiful collection of anecdotes","To call this a history of magic is a bit of a stretch.  It is a book of magic history, but it does not provide a coherent narrative of magic from antiquity to modernity.  Rather, it presents anecdotes about a variety of magicians throughout history without much effort to connect one to the next. However, though it doesn't provide anything resembling either a complete or a coherent history of magic, it does hold the reader's interest.  Much of that is due to the fact that the book centers on stories of magicians whose props or costumes are housed in Copperfield's museum and accompanied by truly marvelous photographs of these various artifacts, making this one of the most beautiful works on magic I have in my entire (fairly extensive) library. Readers unfamiliar with the history of magic or the various colorful characters from magic's past will be delighted to read the meticulously researched anecdotes and (highly abridged) biographical treatments.  Those of us fairly well-versed in magic history will find many (perhaps even most) of the stories quite familiar, but they're well-told (and as I mentioned, demonstrated through excellent photography provided by Homer Liwag) and, as far as I can tell, completely accurate.  There were even a few surprises in the form of a handful of stories I didn't already know. Perhaps rather than calling this a ""history of magic,"" we should consider it a collection of stories *from* magic history about the people Copperfield has found inspiring.  Either way, it's well worth a read.  Copperfield is as successful as he is in magic because he's the kind of person who puts in the work to make sure everything is as good as it can be.  Clearly the same attention to detail has gone into this book, and it's going to be one I'll continue to flip through regularly.","11 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Bob Lewis","4.0","David Copperfield's History of Magic","https://www.amazon.com/David-Copperfields-History-Magic-Copperfield/product-reviews/1982112913/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Forever & Always","I just got my book a couple of hours ago and after I was done with errands, I finally opened the book. Mac always had a way with making people feel better but losing him‚Ä¶is just too big. He‚Äôs always been an inspiration for every single person who felt a little bit different. He‚Äôs always showed his true colors, even when he‚Äôs been hurting. I am only a couple of pages into the book but I‚Äôm already crying. No other celebrity death has caused me to feel like I lost a family member. I still can‚Äôt explain it all but we were almost like kindred spirits. I ADORE Malcom and wish I had gotten the chance to meet him. Hopefully when I find my way to whatever is after this life, I‚Äôll be able to tell him how much I appreciate him. I will show him the tattoo I got for him and we could share stories of the things, bad, not so good stories and then the kind of stories that make you tear up bc you‚Äôre so happy over them. I know for a fact, if Mac was still here, there was no limit to what he could‚Äôve accomplished since even when he‚Äôs passed on‚Ä¶he STILL is making a big difference in so many lives!!! Usually I won‚Äôt write a review before fully reading but this one is different.

That is itself already something to be grateful for. Let us not give up on the idea of freedom, yes, but no less, on the responsibilities of thinking, of listening, and of considering -- which are requisite for any freedom worthy of the name. This book is a perfect chance for exercising these responsibilities. Last but not least: this book is an exceptional example of the good old-fashioned art of an attempt at dispassionate honesty, which certainly doesn't mean that the authors think they have everything entirely figured out.

"Well researched and vetted. Choose to know.","5 stars because the book needs to be read by everyone. Lots of evidence in this book that the pandemic is not about the democrats or republicans as much as dividing and isolating us - a debilitating strategy being used by the technocrats in the biggest power grab the world has ever seen. It was planned, rehearsed, and it's not all about our health - it's about control and money. The book is the easiest, most comprehensive read you'll find that explains, in a nutshell, a lot of what's behind the unlawful mandates: vaccines, big pharma, big tech; the special interests, media, the propaganda and censorship, the transfer of wealth ... the David Martin expose and explanation of patents is gripping; following the trails of Faucci, Gates, and large regulatory agencies controlling our lives is all important in understanding the current lockstep of this reset happening in the US and globally. This high level overview is well vetted proof of what's driving the pandemic - it is not several opinions, as much as facts. I hope it encourages people to become more critical and question what's going on outside of the mainstream narrative. Things are happening fast and in lockstep, as planned so I'm hoping it results in more people speaking out and talking freely to protect our rights and democracy. Did not much care for the ghost writer angle but I'm hoping it deflected the trolls in some small part.","23 Oct 2021","","","Yes","Judy Lindow","5.0","Plandemic: Fear Is the Virus.

"A combination of American history, music history, and personal memoir","This unique book was written by Questlove, the drummer/DJ/Producer and member of The Roots.  In the book he covers music and history, focusing mainly on the years 1971 ‚Äì 2001.  The book has 32 main chapters, with the first 31 chapters each focusing on a specific year starting in 1971, and the last chapter covering 2002 ‚Äì present.  There are about 321 pages of story in the digital version, followed by an Index of songs covered in the book. In the Introduction, Questlove explains the premise of this book.  He notes that he has always associated certain periods of time with specific songs or albums; that his personal memories are intertwined with the music that he remembers listening to during those years.  His parents were musicians, so he has been listening to music and connecting it with the events going on in the world for as long as he can remember. This really is a unique book.  Each chapter starts with a list of major events that happened in that year, written in bold print.  Then there are several paragraphs where Questlove connects the music of that year to the events, or his own personal memories of what was going on in his life.  Throughout the book there are also a few lists in between chapters, that aren't necessarily focused on a specific year, but list some songs that deal with a certain theme.  Questlove writes in a very informal but clever style, with a conversational tone that is also full of wordplay and irony. I really liked reading this book.  It is a combination of American history, musical history, and personal memoir that I haven't seen before.  I also tend to remember periods of time by the songs that  I listened to, so I really connected with the premise.  I learned quite a bit from reading this, and I have even more respect for Questlove than I did before; as he is not just a talented musician, but a competent writer and intellectual as well.","19 Oct 2021","","","Yes","C","5.0","Music Is History","https://www.amazon.com/Music-History-Questlove/product-reviews/1419751433/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Highly Recommend!!","Prior to Fallon, Questlove's world and mine never overlapped.  (I'm Boston area, white, suburban, mom, pushing 60 years.) Very quickly,  I was drawn to his warm personality & storytelling. I started listening to his podcast & have been exposed to people who are fascinating & made even more interesting thru the lens of Questlove.  His enthusiasm and curiosity are boundless. I am listening to the book, it's fantastic - Questlove has a unique talent; weaving personal experience, historical events and music from a perspective that is educated and thoughtful. After decades of hard work, Questlove seems to have ""exploded"" lately---getting noticed by mainstream media.  He 100% deserves all the accolades and the attention--in my humble opinion, he is the real deal. Long way of saying---great book, Questlove is somebody who has something to say & it's worth your time to read or listen to him!","23 Oct 2021","","","Yes","sbm64","5.0","Music Is History","https://www.amazon.com/Music-History-Questlove/product-reviews/1419751433/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Music is the history that makes up the moments that we are","My thanks to NetGalley and the publisher Abrams for an advanced copy of this musical history book. Music is a reflection of the times. Music also has the ability to be timeless. You truly can't understand an era where momentous events occurred without understanding the culture that both added too and was in turn affected by events.  Ahmir Questlove Thompson in his latest tome Music is History has decided to cover the last 50 or so years of music, covering his time on this planet, one song a year, with many asides with a little history to give the song its place in history. Being the same age, and yet culturally removed, I loved this book. I have always loved music, creativity and history, and Questlove has done a wonderful job of mixing all three in his book. Each chapter covers a year, until the 2000's, with a brief list of momentous events, a little biography of Questlove's life at the time, then a discourse on songs, artists, movements genres and more. Grab some paper for you will be writing song titles and band names down. Also included are playlists with various themes, from songs that were close to being perfect to best cover songs and more. The writing is clear and concise with research featuring not just the music but what was going on in the world at the time. As a reader I knew that Questlove was enjoying himself as he wrote, and that feeling was infectious. I've been remiss in reading his other books, one that I will have to remedy. Perfect for music lovers of any kind, of for people who need something in these continuing days of COVID to feel better. Great reading. Great tunes. You can't go wrong.","19 Oct 2021","","","Yes","Kindle Customer","4.0","Music Is History","https://www.amazon.com/Music-History-Questlove/product-reviews/1419751433/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"History of music in the last 50 years","<i>Music is History</i> explores music and history of the past fifty years. This book was different than what I was expecting, which is more on me than the book.  In my high school U.S. history class, the teacher was very into music, and we looked at the way history was tied to the songs that came out in a unit of that class, mostly from the 1960s and 1970s.  I was expecting to this book to be like that, but mostly, this book listed a few of the big news events of each year at the beginning of the chapter, then discussed music‚Äôs history for the year.  There were a few times when the two crossed over, but it wasn‚Äôt nearly as often as I had anticipated.  Questlove also talks about the influence the songs chosen had on his own life.  It was an interesting read, just not what I had anticipated going into it.  I did appreciate that on the audiobook, we got to hear his band playing music at times. Many thanks to NetGalley for providing me an audio ARC of this book.","03 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Stacy Roth","3.0","Music Is History","https://www.amazon.com/Music-History-Questlove/product-reviews/1419751433/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Absolutely abhorrent quality control","I waited 9 months for these cards. I stalked USPS since they shipped Saturday. I've done tarot since 1996 and have ordered so so many different decks throughout the years and this is honestly the worst I've ever gotten. It got two stars because the art is beautiful. If the cards were better quality I'd have loved them. The back edge of my cards? It bent up and causes my cards to stick together. These are impossible to shuffle with this flaw. Won't fan out for choosing a card like other decks. I love the art even on the minor cards so don't think this is a preference thing but these cards are totally not usable for readings unless I do a one card draw and shuffle each card individually. Since others havent bad this issue I suspect this is a quality control issue and I'm just disappointed Update 10/24/2021: I've returned two decks for replacements and finally got a deck I can use! The cards are still sticky so I brushed them with cornstarch and can shuffle them well. The cards are wonderful. But my 2 star rating is going to stay because they need to work on their quality control desperately","19 Oct 2021","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/716GcEp2iWL._SY88.jpg

"Sad","I waited over two moths for this deck and was so disappointed.  The major arcana was well done but the minor is terrible!  Not really related to the movie or characters.  It is a shame as the cards are a nice thickness with a nice coating.  If it was not for the fact that this was a gift from my spouse I would return it immediately. I did go ahead and give them a shuffle and after you shuffle them once or twice all the stickiness goes away and they are a dream to shuffle.  By far the easiest deck to shuffle that I own.  But again with the lack of thought put into the minor arcana I am just heartbroken.  This was a deck I wanted to really love and I just don't, probably because I am more of an intuitive reader and while I don't do to shabby I am not familiar enough to have the minor cards meaning memorized.  Again I really wanted to love them as the movie was a staple in our home number two only to Princess Bride, with my mom now past I was looking forward to all the memories that would be brought back through use of the deck.  Such a missed opportunity and dissapointment.","21 Oct 2021","","","Yes","Holly P.","1.0","Labyrinth Tarot Deck and Guidebook | Movie Tarot Deck","https://www.amazon.com/Labyrinth-Tarot-Deck-Guidebook-Movie/product-reviews/164722182X/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Good art, good collector's item, but does not shuffle well and cards are flimsy.","The art on these cards are beautiful. If you're a fan of Labyrinth, you will keep these cards like I will, simply to add to your collection. These are good memorabilia gifts. But to actually use them as tarot cards is very difficult. The back of the cards are rough in terms of very hard to move when shuffling. They almost stick together when you shuffle. On top of that, the card stock is thin, making them somewhat flimsy and easier to bend than thicker cards. For me, it truly can't be used for tarot. But it is a nice collector's item if you're into labyrinth and tarot.","19 Oct 2021","","","Yes","Grill","2.0","Labyrinth Tarot Deck and Guidebook | Movie Tarot Deck","https://www.amazon.com/Labyrinth-Tarot-Deck-Guidebook-Movie/product-reviews/164722182X/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I was excited to have a Labyrinth themed deck because I have been a huge fan of the movie forever. I, finally, got my deck today after 6 delays in shipping, the date being pushed back multiple times with no real explanation. The box is beautiful, exactly as depicted. The guide book is nice, not terribly robust, but much better than some other books that come in other decks. But the cards... 1) The cards are made of a very flimsy material. I already know that after a few shuffles, they will tear and be completely destroyed. 2) The Major Arcana art work shows thought was put in, but as another reviewer said, the minor arcana has no symbolism, barely any coloring, no detail to work with and hardly even depict anything the guidebook appears to tell you If you buy this deck with the sole intent to display it because you are a fan of the movie, go for it! If you buy this deck with the intent to actually use it...save your money, find a different deck, there are thousands to choose from.

"Full of disappointment if you pop cards","I really wanted this deck to be amazing, I pre-ordered it last year and have been looking forward to it ever ssince. I have reviewed lots of decks on here (Nightmare before Christmas & Daily crystal inspiration, to name a couple) and I am so disappointed with this one. I have included photos of the deck if you would like to see them. I'll start with the positives... The artwork on the Major arcana and court cards is something I really enjoy. The box is nice and well made. I received all the cards without any duplicates. The book is nice. .... thats about it with positives .... Negatives; The card stock is very flimsy to the point I'm afraid I'm going to crush them when I shuffle and they are already dented from a few shuffles. The cards are smooth and velvety so for 'card popper' they are unfortunately completely useless to me. The definitions in the book ARE NOT from nor do most of them follow the original RIDER-WAITE deck which is how I read them. Not a huge deal to me as I don't need the book, just something I want others to know. All of the non court cards are pip cards, which I personally find super disappointing. As far as the suits are concerned with this deck... Cups is replaced by Pots Swords is replaced by Feathers Wands is replaced by Poles Pentacles is replaced by Junk .... I personally get really confused when decks do this and while I understand it wanting to stay close to the movie and don't understand why it was turned into a pip instead of using parts from the film. I prolly wouldn't mind it as much. All in all I'm super disappointed in this and even thinking about canceling my order for the Disney Villians Tarot cards coming out next month.

"Great deck!!!","Yes!! I finally received this deck as I had it preordered since the beginning. This deck is well thought out contrary to another review, it is a typical pip style deck but it is actually a beautiful and well thought out.  The deck and the guide book is easy to decipher even for a beginner. The imagery is gorgeous and I like the stripes on the inside of the box which match Toby's onesie from the Movie. I laughed so hard with a few of the cards from the deck, SUPER cute with the names and imagery. üòÜ  It's truly a must have for a fan of the movie and a tarot collector alike. I actually think this deck is better then most pip style decks I've purchased in the past especially since the guide book makes this an easy to understand tarot deck even though it's a pip style deck. My only complaint is that I would have really enjoyed seeing a card that included both Sarah and the Goblin King together in one card. They are both included but not together in one card. It would have been nice to see the dance scene or the end scene. They could have made the dancers card to include Sarah and the Goblin King together  or a picture of them with the end scene where there was the clock and the time was running out. Whyyy? Okay, I'm nit picking because they had such chemistry that it would have been great to see a card like that. Haha. Regardless, I'm glad I purchased this deck and would buy it again. üíú","21 Oct 2021","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81LMou1XgVL._SY88.jpg

I feel the opportunity to use the iconic red book for the tarot deck book was completely missed. I agree with another review about the pip cards. They are so obvious in the deck and stick out against the artwork and not in a good way. The deck shuffled fine for me. Though they are not the thickest cards but they are decent. I would say they are thicker than a deck of cards. Over all, they are alright.

"Beautiful, but it‚Äôs a pip deck","This is a gorgeous deck, and the major arcana are really interesting to think about in the light of the movie. I think the characters they picked are spot on. I was disappointed, however, when I saw the minor arcana, which are pips. I know plenty of people prefer pips, but I‚Äôm not one of them. It turns the tarot into a memorization game rather than the intuitive experience it‚Äôs supposed to be. And the guidebook gives really awesome scenarios from the movie that describe the meaning of each card. It would have been worth it to actually illustrate those things for the cards. That‚Äôs my big gripe with this deck, and what lost it the star. This deck could have been spectacular, but with pips it falls short. Otherwise, the card stock is really nice. Matte, feels great in the hand. The guidebook is thoughtful and well-done.

"Lovely stroll down memory lane","I wasn‚Äôt certain when I ordered this book what it was going to entail but was pleasantly surprised to find it to be a sort of compilation of the best quotes and moments throughout the Bridgerton series. It is especially interesting for the fans of the books themselves as the Netflix series only has a brief mention in the foreword of the book. That was fine with me as I don‚Äôt intend to watch the series. (I‚Äôm just not into tv.)

"A must for Bridgerton fans","The Wit and Wisdom of Bridgerton - Lady Whistledown's Official Guide by Julia Quinn is a delightful reminder of why I love her historical romance series The Bridgertons so darn much!  I need to break out my audiobooks and take a trip down memory lane with the entire cast from beginning to end. Lady Whistledown, author of the gossip sheet Society Papers, is our guide to all the members of the Bridgerton family.  Each chapter highlights a different character.  This includes a new introduction by Lady Whistledown herself, quotes from the character and comments other characters made about them during the course of the series.  It's a reminder of all the familial love and affection, romances and wit that I came to love. It took me a bit to get into the rhythm of the layout of each chapter.  Reading about the first few characters was a bit confusing, and I had to do a bit re-reading.  But once I got the hang of it I was in Bridgerton heaven!  The most heartwarming chapter concerns Violet, the matriarch of the family; she was the glue that held them all together.  Other favorite characters of mine included Colin, Gregory and Hyacinth.  One thing I absolutely loved in the series, and was reminded of here, was the family's brutality in playing Pall Mall.  It always made me laugh, especially the Mallet of Death!  The author made mention of the Netflix series The Bridgertons, but that's not something I'm interested in.  I'm a purist.  I want to see the characters in my mind the way I pictured them through reading.  As we all know, the book is ALWAYS better.  This book is a charming companion to one of the best series of all time.  If you're a fan, you will just adore it. I received an ARC of this book courtesy of the publisher and NetGalley.  I received no compensation for my review, and all thoughts and opinions expressed are entirely my own.","09 Nov 2021","","","Yes","K.

"Reliving the joy of the Bridgertons","This was a fun immersion into all things Bridgerton and I loved every bit of it! While this does not have any new content, other than a bit from Lady Whistledown, it has so many moments of goodness that make up each book and thereby, the whole series.  Each chapter covers a different character and within are quotes that paint a perfect picture of that character.  From the deepest heartfelt moments, to those that had me laughing again as it reminded me of all the humor this series contains. This is definitely for those who have already read and loved the books.  Any fan will enjoy this but the formatting for the printed book is exquisite and definitely something a hard core fan would love to have on their shelf.  I‚Äôm totally in book envy at just the thought! But what really has me cheering for this book is the way it thrust me back into the joy that is the Bridgertons and thereby making me fall in love with them all over again.","09 Nov 2021","","","Yes","carvanz","5.0","The Wit and Wisdom of Bridgerton: Lady Whistledown's Official Guide (The Bridgertons)","https://www.amazon.com/Wit-Wisdom-Bridgerton-Whistledowns-Bridgertons/product-reviews/0063216019/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"For fans of the Bridgerton books!","This was such a cute collection for fans of the Bridgerton series, specifically for those who have read the books. This is a beautifully bound addition, I love the cover and how pretty the formatting is on the inside. The book is a fun compilation of snippets, quotes, wit, and wisdom from Lady Whistledown and about the beloved Bridgerton characters. This volume shares favorite quotes from the Bridgerton books that best represent and illuminate each character, picked out by author Julia Quinn. Every character featured also gets a brand new Lady Whistledown entry which was so fun and special to read! ‚ÄúA Bridgerton. To be such is to know that you are part of a family tightly webbed with staunch loyalty and unquestioning love. And laughter. Always laughter.‚Äù The book is broken up by characters and those featured are Anthony, Kate, Benedict, Colin, Penelope, Daphne, Simon, Eloisa, Francesca, Gregory, Hyacinth, Violet, and Lady Danbury. This felt like you were reading a collection of all the moments you would have annotated about the characters when reading the series, or in this case what JQ herself annotated about each character. It shares sweet moments, swoony moments, the moments that pull at your heartstrings, the parts that made you cry, the moments that had you laughing, definitely a couple Mallet of Death moments, and just all the perfect moments that made you fall in love with these characters. While all the quotes and passages are moments from the Bridgerton series, in the case of Colin‚Äôs section we do get a passage about him from First Comes Scandal (The Rokesbys series). Thank you so much to the publisher, Avon Books, for my gifted copy of this beautiful book. I adored reading it and remembering all my favorite Bridgerton moments.","09 Nov 2021","","","Yes","ChristiReadsALot","4.0","The Wit and Wisdom of Bridgerton: Lady Whistledown's Official Guide (The Bridgertons)","https://www.amazon.com/Wit-Wisdom-Bridgerton-Whistledowns-Bridgertons/product-reviews/0063216019/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"A treat for fans of the Bridgerton series","The Wit and Wisdom of Bridgerton is a fun treat for fans of Julia Quinn‚Äôs Bridgerton series. It‚Äôs a compendium of quotes from the series spotlighting each of the eight Bridgerton siblings plus Kate, Penelope, Simon, Violet, and Lady Danbury. I loved the collection of quotes from the books and was interested to see what Quinn would pick out to highlight each character. Each character is introduced with a new column by Lady Whistledown, but aside from that the text is all pulled from the Bridgerton series (plus one Rokesby book). If you‚Äôre looking for some insight into Bridgerton the show on Netflix, this is not that. Aside from Quinn‚Äôs introduction, The Wit and Wisdom of Bridgerton is entirely focused on the books themselves. If you haven‚Äôt read the series I don‚Äôt think this collection will have the impact for you that it did for me (especially as you get farther down the Bridgerton sibling line to characters who are not heavily featured in season one of the television show). I delighted in revisiting my favorite characters in this format and I highly recommend this for anyone who loves the books and wants to have a collection of quotes to simply pick out and enjoy whenever the mood strikes. The Wit and Wisdom of Bridgerton serves as a lovely reminder of all the things I love about the Bridgertons, their relationships (romantic and familial), and Quinn‚Äôs sparkling prose. I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.","09 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Kimberly","4.0","The Wit and Wisdom of Bridgerton: Lady Whistledown's Official Guide (The Bridgertons)","https://www.amazon.com/Wit-Wisdom-Bridgerton-Whistledowns-Bridgertons/product-reviews/0063216019/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"A hilarious and wildly imaginative book about Hip-Hop","Books written about Hip-Hop can be chock full of minutiae, factoids, and mention a gang of obscure people and facts dating back to its pre-history, focusing mostly on Rap's Old School era, New School era through the Golden Eras... However, Shea Serrano has found a way to write a throughly engaging and fun to read book about Rap that can be enjoyed by Rap nerds and casual fans alike. You will be laughing and learning new things simultaneously. Also, Arturo Torres' incredible illustrations only make this book even more of a must own. Highly recommended and a great gift for the upcoming holiday season.","28 Oct 2021","","","Yes","Amazon Customer","5.0","Hip-Hop (And Other Things)","https://www.amazon.com/Hip-Hop-Other-Things-Shea-Serrano/product-reviews/1538730227/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
