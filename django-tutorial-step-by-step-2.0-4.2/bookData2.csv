"I CANNOT PUT IT DOWN","From the moment you pick up the book, it's a work of art. The slipcover has a texture that seems to go with the  the selected cover art that was specificly created for the book. As soon as I opened the book and began reading, I could hear Will's voice in my head reading the words to me. Will and Mark did a wonderful job of transferring Will's thoughts, stories and words and bringing his experiences to life in the book. It's such an easy read. I am loving the ""autobiography"" genre lately. It's so fascinating to learn about someone's life and experiences and really realize that we all have so much in common.","18 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Shelly L.","5.0","Will","https://www.amazon.com/Will-Mark-Manson-ebook/product-reviews/B096LPZXCH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","RUGKG9YXKRJC5"
"Not signed","Sucks that the pre-order ""signed"" book notice was obviously a lie to get orders and that's not ok. I want to support Will but also wish I had supported an independently owned bookstore instead, if I wasn't going to get a signed copy anyway. That's the reason for my rating but looks to be a great book","12 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Leah Cook","2.0","Will","https://www.amazon.com/Will-Mark-Manson-ebook/product-reviews/B096LPZXCH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","R3FHQAYXVEFKGV"
"Audible was good","I bought the book to highlight important pieces. I figured Will would have a few gems in there. If you are a fan of Will you will enjoy the audible, feels like you are sitting with a friend telling u about his life story. The only reason I didn't give a five is that I felt that the emotions on some parts were not natural but acting (but that's just my opinion). Other than that it was a food listen...I want to hear more.","12 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Faye East","4.0","Will","https://www.amazon.com/Will-Mark-Manson-ebook/product-reviews/B096LPZXCH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","R2VL62VLV7Z79F"
"The truth is not always easy","I loved how open and truthful Will was about his life, about his fears, and insecurities. This book has touched me in so many ways, living in fear of the one you love, rather a parent or a lover, changes you, and all your relationships. I've always been a big fan of Will and Jada. I've always heard little snippets of gossip about his life and relationships. People have a way of criticizing, and passing judgement on things without knowing the full story. This book has filled in a lot of blanks. And has also made me look at my own life, and understand more how fear has changed the dynamics in my life. And has me thinking on how I can change them. Thank you Will for giving us a real part of you!‚ù§Ô∏è","13 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Iris Jones","5.0","Will","https://www.amazon.com/Will-Mark-Manson-ebook/product-reviews/B096LPZXCH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","R2ES21JQ0AH0VD"

"Authentic, Hilarious and Thought provoking","Amazing story Will! But what I got most from this book, other than knowing what u did to get yourself to the top of the hill, other what happened after the string of blockbuster success, other than laughing out loud at some sequences (euphemisms) - is really the importance of self discovery, self awareness, asking critical questions that everyone should be asking in their life.

"A Great Read that was Funnier and Deeper than I Expected","While not as moving as Trevor Noah‚Äôs Born a Crime or as thought provoking as Travels by Michael Crichton, this is, overall, one of the best memoirs I have read. Smith‚Äôs famous charisma is on full display here and that alone makes it worth a read. But hidden amongst the hilarious tales from his charmed life and the Ted Talk style motivational platitudes are surprisingly honest admissions about his flaws, heartbreaking examinations of domestic abuse and illuminating insights about the joys and horrors of life in an American inner city. The main subject of the book is certainly Smith himself, but like Health Ledger‚Äôs Joker in The Dark Knight, the dominant character is Smith‚Äôs father, a complicated cross between hero and villain. Smith makes his position on his father clear by the end of the book, but I‚Äôm not sure I agree with him or that I could have gone on to a landmark career‚Äîor any career at all‚Äîif I had witnessed someone do those things to my mother. No matter where your opinion falls, the allegory of The Wall will get to you. But that‚Äôs only if you can stop laughing long enough to think about it, which this book makes it hard to do. I know because I‚Äôm still laughing over the story about Melanie Parker and the slippers.","10 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Cato","5.0","Will","https://www.amazon.com/Will-Mark-Manson-ebook/product-reviews/B096LPZXCH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews","R3MQ3CGXFYOVSO"

"What a life !!!","I loved learning all the interesting stories of his life and the people who helped him become who he is today. What an amazing life he has lived. The foul language in the book was very difficult for me.

"WELL DONE WILL","I must admit there is more cussing in this book than I have ever heard out of Will Smiths mouth; however, his ability to tell his story with complete integrity deems it a must I suppose. I have been totally engaged since it started. Very well written and very well read. You can feel the passion of this work coming through clearly. Definitely a must read/listen! 16 hours of non stop action, you will be completely locked in from beginning to end.","16 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Crystal","5.0","Will","https://www.amazon.com/Will-Mark-Manson-ebook/product-reviews/B096LPZXCH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews","R3NP5VVSMSTWP6"

"Good Memoir","3.75/5.0 Stars I am not much of a nonfiction reader, but this year I decided to give some a chance. A few weeks ago, Dave Grohl released his memoir The Storyteller. That memoir was amazing, so when I saw that Will Smith released one, I quickly went to Amazon and read the preview. I enjoyed what I read and quickly went to the store to pick it up. Sadly, Will didn't live up to the expectations that I had for it and I can't quite put my finger on why. There are times that the story didn't flow. That may be because the book is by Will Smith and Mark Manson. Sometimes I found myself wondering if a part that I was reading was Will or Mark. I don't want to poo poo the book. It is good. If you are a fan of Will Smith (I am a fan) then you will enjoy this. You learn about his life journey and how he became the Will we know. We learn about struggles. We learn about successes. If I could make a recommendation on how to read it, get the audiobook. I cannot say enough great things about the audiobook, but perhaps the best part about it is the fact that when he talks about a song or scene from Fresh Prince, he has the audio clip for it and it isn't just Will reading it. That really added to the story. I cannot recommend the audiobook enough.","13 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Preston Leigh","4.0","Will","https://www.amazon.com/Will-Mark-Manson-ebook/product-reviews/B096LPZXCH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews","R3AI9H5NCD2QM1"
