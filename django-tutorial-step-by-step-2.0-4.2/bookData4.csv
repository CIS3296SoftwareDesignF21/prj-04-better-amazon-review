"I CANNOT PUT IT DOWN","From the moment you pick up the book, it's a work of art. The slipcover has a texture that seems to go with the  the selected cover art that was specificly created for the book. As soon as I opened the book and began reading, I could hear Will's voice in my head reading the words to me. Will and Mark did a wonderful job of transferring Will's thoughts, stories and words and bringing his experiences to life in the book. It's such an easy read. I am loving the ""autobiography"" genre lately. It's so fascinating to learn about someone's life and experiences and really realize that we all have so much in common.","18 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Shelly L.","5.0","Will","https://www.amazon.com/Will-Smith/product-reviews/1984877925/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","1984877925","RUGKG9YXKRJC5"
"Audible was good","I bought the book to highlight important pieces. I figured Will would have a few gems in there. If you are a fan of Will you will enjoy the audible, feels like you are sitting with a friend telling u about his life story. The only reason I didn't give a five is that I felt that the emotions on some parts were not natural but acting (but that's just my opinion). Other than that it was a food listen...I want to hear more.","12 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Faye East","4.0","Will","https://www.amazon.com/Will-Smith/product-reviews/1984877925/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","1984877925","R2VL62VLV7Z79F"
"Not signed","Sucks that the pre-order ""signed"" book notice was obviously a lie to get orders and that's not ok. I want to support Will but also wish I had supported an independently owned bookstore instead, if I wasn't going to get a signed copy anyway.

"The truth is not always easy","I loved how open and truthful Will was about his life, about his fears, and insecurities. This book has touched me in so many ways, living in fear of the one you love, rather a parent or a lover, changes you, and all your relationships. I've always been a big fan of Will and Jada. I've always heard little snippets of gossip about his life and relationships. People have a way of criticizing, and passing judgement on things without knowing the full story. This book has filled in a lot of blanks. And has also made me look at my own life, and understand more how fear has changed the dynamics in my life. And has me thinking on how I can change them. Thank you Will for giving us a real part of you!‚ù§Ô∏è","13 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Iris Jones","5.0","Will","https://www.amazon.com/Will-Smith/product-reviews/1984877925/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","1984877925","R2ES21JQ0AH0VD"
"What a great read!!!!","I was pleasantly surprised with the point of view & style of writing in the book.  I have always enjoyed him on talk shows & watched him last week on Jimmy Fallon.

"Authentic, Hilarious and Thought provoking","Amazing story Will! But what I got most from this book, other than knowing what u did to get yourself to the top of the hill, other what happened after the string of blockbuster success, other than laughing out loud at some sequences (euphemisms) - is really the importance of self discovery, self awareness, asking critical questions that everyone should be asking in their life. Thank you for this story. Easily one of the best, if not the best memoirs I have came across.","14 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Henry","5.0","Will","https://www.amazon.com/Will-Smith/product-reviews/1984877925/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","1984877925","R2O75AHYRS10IA"

"A Great Read that was Funnier and Deeper than I Expected","While not as moving as Trevor Noah‚Äôs Born a Crime or as thought provoking as Travels by Michael Crichton, this is, overall, one of the best memoirs I have read. Smith‚Äôs famous charisma is on full display here and that alone makes it worth a read. But hidden amongst the hilarious tales from his charmed life and the Ted Talk style motivational platitudes are surprisingly honest admissions about his flaws, heartbreaking examinations of domestic abuse and illuminating insights about the joys and horrors of life in an American inner city. The main subject of the book is certainly Smith himself, but like Health Ledger‚Äôs Joker in The Dark Knight, the dominant character is Smith‚Äôs father, a complicated cross between hero and villain. Smith makes his position on his father clear by the end of the book, but I‚Äôm not sure I agree with him or that I could have gone on to a landmark career‚Äîor any career at all‚Äîif I had witnessed someone do those things to my mother. No matter where your opinion falls, the allegory of The Wall will get to you. But that‚Äôs only if you can stop laughing long enough to think about it, which this book makes it hard to do. I know because I‚Äôm still laughing over the story about Melanie Parker and the slippers.","10 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Cato","5.0","Will","https://www.amazon.com/Will-Smith/product-reviews/1984877925/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8&reviewerType=all_reviews","1984877925","R3MQ3CGXFYOVSO"

"Good Memoir","3.75/5.0 Stars I am not much of a nonfiction reader, but this year I decided to give some a chance. A few weeks ago, Dave Grohl released his memoir The Storyteller. That memoir was amazing, so when I saw that Will Smith released one, I quickly went to Amazon and read the preview. I enjoyed what I read and quickly went to the store to pick it up. Sadly, Will didn't live up to the expectations that I had for it and I can't quite put my finger on why. There are times that the story didn't flow. That may be because the book is by Will Smith and Mark Manson. Sometimes I found myself wondering if a part that I was reading was Will or Mark. I don't want to poo poo the book. It is good. If you are a fan of Will Smith (I am a fan) then you will enjoy this. You learn about his life journey and how he became the Will we know. We learn about struggles. We learn about successes. If I could make a recommendation on how to read it, get the audiobook. I cannot say enough great things about the audiobook, but perhaps the best part about it is the fact that when he talks about a song or scene from Fresh Prince, he has the audio clip for it and it isn't just Will reading it. That really added to the story. I cannot recommend the audiobook enough.","13 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Preston Leigh","4.0","Will","https://www.amazon.com/Will-Smith/product-reviews/1984877925/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_10?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=10&reviewerType=all_reviews","1984877925","R3AI9H5NCD2QM1"

"Beautiful, eclectic set of books","Pleasantly surprised by how well designed these two books are. They really ARE an autobiography, just not a typical one. He writes about his life and his loves and his feelings. And those feelings reveal Paul in all of his complexity. In his essays about each song, sometimes he's philosophic, sometimes he's moving -- or angry, quirky, irritating. And sometimes he's really really funny. And there's so much history throughout this book about British and American culture. I bought the Let It Be box set recently and, frankly, have been experiencing buyer's remorse ever since because of its $125 price. But McCartney's massive 2-book set is much better designed and it's filled with beautiful writing, never-before-seen photos, and memorabilia. And it cost half of what I paid for the Let Bet set! It's absolutely a brilliant collection.","03 Nov 2021","","","Yes","M.

"Love the Beatles, but disappointed in this","I do love the Beatles, but was expecting more. Many of the songs I was curious about, are not in the book. There are conflicts of what we learned in public articles about the origins of the songs. The way the book is written reflects Paul's style of speaking, but some of the stories are odd and don't click with what we have previously learned. Lots of unusual photos and artwork is in the book with no reference to what or why they are there. Seems like a cut and paste Hodge podge of odd stuff.

"A great memoir from one of the greatest songwriters ever!","Songwriters will usually write about what they know or have experienced. Nowhere is that more evident than in the lyrics of Paul McCartney and his songwriting partner, John Lennon. They wrote some of the best songs in the history of music and many of them are found in this two volume set.  Paul talks about the classics, like  Yesterday, Let It Be, Long and Winding Road and others. He also talks about lesser known songs as well and the people who influenced his writings, such as his late wife, Linda Eastman McCartney.

"It‚Äôs just ok","The set is quite heavy. Quite expensive. Beautifully done. The paper used has been harvested from forests that are managed with an eye to sustainability and social and environmental responsibility.  Whatever that means. At this moment I am not impressed.  This book may have be perfect or could have been perfect but when McCartney starts to get political I stopped reading.  I don‚Äôt want to hear about world events and his views on them. I want to read about the stories behind the lyrics. About the Fab 4. The Beatles! Doesn‚Äôt matter if I agree with him or not.  I did not buy an expensive BEATLES lyrics book to hear his side of politics.  Or global warming.  I stopped reading and put it away. Why do these artist think I care about their views?  I honestly do not. This is why I buy and read books!  To escape all that poison on tv and social media. Even if it‚Äôs for a few hours I want to escape & read. We hear about this stuff all day.  Every day. Frankly I am sick that all of us ‚Äúhumans‚Äù are constantly being divided. Intentionally or unintentionally. Left or right. Black or white. Religious or not. Can‚Äôt we just ‚ÄúCome Together‚Äù without prejudices? Enjoy a song? Enjoy a book? Enjoy a story? McCartneys statement left me with a bad impression and I didn‚Äôt get even through half the book. Many of you will love it.  I know I would have.  I LOVE the Beatles...MUSIC.  Just not personal views on world events. My son gifted me this set. I am not getting paid by anyone.

Paul also includes his political viewpoints throughout which I certainly do not want to hear. The massive hypocrisy of droning on and on about climate change when the book was printed in China is beyond belief. The book is beautifully produced on nice paper and the presentation is impeccable. But that can't negate the fact there is absolutely nothing new or revealing here. Paul has told all of these stories so many times I can recite them word-perfect.

I can tell you that in two words, Flaming Pie.  Flaming Pie is my second favorite Macca song of all time and yet, it didn't make the cut.  That wasn't all, I looked and looked to make sure I didn't miss these too, Ballroom Dancing, Take it Away, Press, Beautiful Night, and Wanderlust.

"Nothing Too Much Just Out Of Sight","This tremendous book has taken me a full week to read and experience cover to cover. What a joy it has been! It is a very candid book about Paul's songwriting processes and the circumstances, relationships, cultures and philosophies that brought them to life. You will also learn a tremendous amount about Paul's worlds, loves and inspirations. Nothing has been whitewashed, his various comments on Jane Asher and John Lennon were startling. As this never pretended to be an autobiography, selective parts of his public life have been omitted as he is of course entitled to do. Such a great book for a McCartney fan, it is at least as good as the Beatles' Anthology, if not better due to the deeper dives.","09 Nov 2021","","","Yes","David Bower","5.0","The Lyrics: 1956 to the Present","https://www.amazon.com/Lyrics-1956-Present-Paul-McCartney/product-reviews/163149256X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews","163149256X","R80NIAFCHJAKN"

"He tosses words up in the air...and they become magic","These volumes are indeed magical.  Sir Paul writes in his typically conversational tone...if I close my eyes, I can almost hear him chatting about his songs in the vein in which these remembrances have been written.  I've listened to several of his interviews about these books where he reads from them.  The songs are treasures and his commentary about them is wonderful.  He writes that he doesn't know where the selection came from; he didn't select the songs, he was asked by Paul Muldoon over the course of their sessions during the five years they worked together on this, to comment on several songs a session and Muldoon provided the list.  Those I was not familiar with, mostly from his early Wings years, I've listened to as he writes about them and you really get valuable context.  I've been a McCartney fan since 1964, when I was 10, and first heard The Beatles at summer camp.

"A revealing look behind the scenes of the Sopranos...","There have been tons of Soprano 'gear' since the show ended in 2007 -- books, cookbooks, CDs, podcasts, even calendars and puzzles. But I've found nothing that encompasses the 'whole thing' like WOKE UP THIS MORNING. The revealing, poignant and sometimes hilarious memories of Sopranos' actors Michael Imperiole (Christopher), and Steve Schirripa (Bobby Baccalieri), are augmented by many hours of new interviews with Imperiole, Schirripa, Steve Van Zandt, David Chase, Lorraine Bracco and many others from the Sopranos set. Sharply assembled by long-time journalist Phil Lerman (of America's Most Wanted fame), the book is an unflinching look at the challenges of getting the show on TV in the first place, and how the actors reacted and grew with their roles. Most celebrity interviews usually devolve into he or she 'was a pleasure to work with' platitudes. Not so with WOKE UP, where tensions and laughter on the set share the pages with the ultimate triumph of a show that changed not only television but the creative talents involved.","06 Nov 2021","","","Yes","David Colton","5.0","Woke Up This Morning: The Definitive Oral History of The Sopranos","https://www.amazon.com/Woke-Up-This-Morning-Definitive/product-reviews/0063090023/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","0063090023","R16F4UOTEQTZ45"
"Phenomenal","For all the naysayers on here saying this is not a book - fuhgetaboutit. This is an oral history which happens to my favorite type of memoir. Everybody who's anybody from the show was interviewed. With the exception of Tony Sirico, which they don't really address why.  I had to to google him to see if he was still alive. The hallmark of any good book (that's right clowns, this is a great book), is that you don't want it to end. I loved this book so much I would only limit myself to a few chapters at a time to prolong it. Simply wonderful, personal, intimate, behind the scenes remembrances from cast and crew.

I have watched the series 3 times and now I am re-watching it with my wife due to the fact that HBO added audio descriptions which also offer a lot of insight into the story and the characters. Really excited that they did this in 2021. This is one of those incredibly rare shows that gets even better every time you are watching it again. The Woke Up This Morning audiobook dives even further into all the events surrounding the show and each of the guests will share with us those facts in their own voice, which I always appreciate. I‚Äôve been waiting for this audiobook for a few months now and today I am really excited to be able to finally listen to it. From cast members to writers and other people involved with the production, each of them will tell their story about how they were a part of The Sopranos. The Talking Sopranos podcast is also a great resource for those who love the best show in the world and I highly recommend it as well to real fans.

"Ignore the haters this book rocks!","Will admit upfront I‚Äôve only read a little more than half the book so far.  That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs over 500 pages, I have a life and there‚Äôs just so many hours in a day one can read. So anyone who posted negative reviews of Woke Up This Morning a day or two after it came out are full of it. They skimmed it, read a few things they heard on the podcast, and immediately assumed the entire book is a transcript. News flash:  It‚Äôs not.  It‚Äôs much more than that.  Broken down season by season, has brand new interviews,  awesome color photos and so much more. Yes there‚Äôs some overlap here and there, but so what? If you‚Äôre a true Sopranos fan you‚Äôll love every page. Michael & Steve did a great job putting this together.

"Book as a whole 5/5. Picture/print  quality 2/5","Like others have mentioned, this is perfect for any fan of the show. The fan art throughout is amazing, and the commentary from the cast will instantly bring a smile to your face. However, some photos in the first half looks as though they we being printed during an earthquake‚Ä¶misaligned and/or super blurry. Although they don‚Äôt take away from the book as a whole, it‚Äôs still pretty disappointing to see.

"Great great great deck‚Ä¶ Production quality issues.","Your browser does not support HTML5 video. The deck itself is great. The art is great. The choice of characters to their Tarot counter part is well chosen. My only complaint is that 3 cards (that I found so far) have some weird production issues. It came sealed and everything so it‚Äôs strange to find, what looks like, scratch marks on the back of some cards. Once again, the art is fantastic and the guide book is well written.  It got 3 stars because I waited so long for this deck, for it to come with some odd problems.","11 Nov 2021","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71Nw5SEr3oL._SY88.jpg

"Lots of Villain-less cards","I was super excited to get this deck and I do love it, however after seeing some unexpected villains I thought I would see them all. Lots of villains are repeated (which is fine), but i was hoping to see more villains creatively incorporated into each card, since all the sample images had villains. Not the easiest cards to use and the matte effect resulted in a couple of my cards with visible scratches which is unfortunate. This is mainly just a novelty deck for me to use so it will be ok, but I'm guessing for heavy use they probably will scuff up pretty quick.","10 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Zee","4.0","Disney Villains Tarot Deck and Guidebook | Movie Tarot Deck | Pop Culture Tarot","https://www.amazon.com/Disney-Villains-Tarot-Guidebook-Culture/product-reviews/1647221560/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","1647221560","R3968H2DTST12S"

"A fun twist on classic themes, but lacking in quailty.","The theaming and  art style of the deck are wonderful. I am a huge Disney fan, and have been reading Tarot for some time, and seeing these classic Disney Villans translated to Tarot themes was a great experience. The guide book is well written, mixing in classic Tarot with the personality of the villan chosen to represent the card. And the villains were chosen so carefully, it almost makes me wonder why I never saw the cards traits in the villains before. The only major concern I have with the deck, is the card stock and finish. The cardstock is thinner than most of the decks I own, which would at least make shuffling them easier, if they didn't have a satin-esque finish to them. The finish makes then stick to each other, which is not great for how I draw my cards from the deck. But the flip side of the coin is that they at least feel great in the hand.","09 Nov 2021","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81B0-OhjDfL._SY88.jpg","Yes","KB","4.0","Disney Villains Tarot Deck and Guidebook | Movie Tarot Deck | Pop Culture Tarot","https://www.amazon.com/Disney-Villains-Tarot-Guidebook-Culture/product-reviews/1647221560/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","1647221560","R2YDBVPMHSX9S3"
"Gorgeous cards but hard to shuffle","The cards are beautifully designed, even if the character choices for some cards were questionable. However, the material of the cards makes it nearly impossible to shuffle them properly. My advice is to line the cards face down in a row and pick out the cards that call to you rather than trying to shuffle them. Good news is that the cards are beautiful and the guidebook has mostly correct information! Worth noting that Hans is missing from this deck. Which I think means they might be planning on making a separate Frozen tarot deck.","10 Nov 2021","","","Yes","bren","4.0","Disney Villains Tarot Deck and Guidebook | Movie Tarot Deck | Pop Culture Tarot","https://www.amazon.com/Disney-Villains-Tarot-Guidebook-Culture/product-reviews/1647221560/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","1647221560","R1XX9BDYL5YWOF"

"For Disney lovers and tarot readers","Was it really worth the wait? Kinda yea. I‚Äôm a Disney lover so anything Disney I‚Äôm sold. The art is amazing however the card stock is thin and the cards were sticking together (hoping they go away with some time). The guide book is pretty confusing for someone that is beginning same goes with the imagery.

"Disney Tarot","They are good cards and great art work,but I was just expecting for the price and the length of time it took for them to come out,the cards would have been of better quality, the cards are made very similar to regular playing card stock , so everyday use will quickly damage the art prints on the cards and the edges of the cards, the card stock is not bad,but it is not all that durable for everyday use , I thought because they were delayed in being sent out so many times it would have been of better quality. But that was just my personal thoughts. They are beautiful cards don't get me wrong, but I wish I could use them like I wanted to originally, but I don't want to  damage them . Maybe they should try a reprint on better card stock,or maybe lower the price. The Night Mare Before Christmas cards are absolutely beautiful and the card stock on them is what these should have been.Same price as these but way better quality .","12 Nov 2021","","","Yes","Raven M.","4.0","Disney Villains Tarot Deck and Guidebook | Movie Tarot Deck | Pop Culture Tarot","https://www.amazon.com/Disney-Villains-Tarot-Guidebook-Culture/product-reviews/1647221560/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7&reviewerType=all_reviews","1647221560","R2EUXMRZ4QSOSD"

"Lots of missed opportunities","1. Art: beautiful, no complaints! 2. Card stock: I read reviews saying that it was crappy, cheap card stock. I‚Äôm actually happy with the card stock. I‚Äôve definitely had cheaper card stock on other decks. They are considerably thick yet flexible, with a matte finish. They don‚Äôt feel cheap like cardboard. 3. Imagery: some of the cards make so much sense (see pic #1). A lot of the cards just don‚Äôt (see pic #2). Lots of missed opportunities. Why have the gators from Rescuers on Strength, instead of Scar (the lion)? Why have villains from the Sword in the Stone (keyword SWORD), featured in the suit of Wands? For most of the deck, it seemed whoever put them together had very little working knowledge of the tarot, and just slapped random villains on random cards. Some villains are over-used (ie Scar, see pic #3), while others are left out all-together. 4. The deck probably won‚Äôt make sense for a beginner. Unlike the traditional Rider Waite, most of the minor arcana (see pic #4) don‚Äôt have images to help the reader interpret the meaning. They kept the minor super simple, another missed opportunity. I think they could have done SO MUCH with this deck. I hope they come out with another one that isn‚Äôt JUST villains, but utilizes a variety of characters. The idea with villains is cool, but limiting. And I hope they assign someone with knowledge of the tarot to the task!","12 Nov 2021","","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81-K5W7GEkL._SY88.jpg

"Fantastic read!","If you can recount any sort of punk rock glory days, you can probably also recall the constant ""sellout tightrope"" your favorite band must have tried to walk- how to get their music heard and fill venues without appearing to compromise their values? This book tells the story of several different bands who tried to make the jump from indie to ""sellout"", and details how that worked out for them. Spoiler: it didn't, often. This book is fascinating even if you aren't familiar with all of the bands included, and if you're a fan of any of them, you'll learn something new. I am a hardcore Green Day/Lookout Records nerd going way back and was aware of what Green Day went through when they left Lookout, but there was a lot detailed here that I didn't know. I came away from reading Jawbreaker's part with an even stronger sense of loss for what might have been- the greatest band the world doesn't (but should) know. If you're a person who enjoys highly detailed, well-written accounts of what goes on behind the scenes when major labels try to make money gambling on what will be The Next Big Thing, you'll really enjoy this deep dive.","11 Nov 2021","","","Yes","ItsJess","5.0","Sellout: The Major-Label Feeding Frenzy That Swept Punk, Emo, and Hardcore (1994‚Äì2007)","https://www.amazon.com/Sellout-Feeding-Frenzy-Hardcore-1994-2007/product-reviews/0358244307/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","0358244307","RSUI2YNEF4N3N"

"Nostalgic and thought provoking","Sellout by Dan Ozzi is one of the most enjoyable reads I have had in quite some time (within what I think of as ""entertainment"" reads, ones both about and for my entertainment) while also bringing to light the many conflicting aspects of the overused idea of selling out. As a concept, selling out has a long history. Within music it easily predates punk and within other forms of entertainment, such as sports and writing, it goes back even further. And it is always a questionable idea when applied from the outside, in other words, by fans or journalists catering to those fans. Yet the vast majority of us have used it to discount what some celebrity, individual or collective like a team, has done that we felt went against what we expected. And, as some of the stories in this book show, those artists use the concept to pose as some kind of special entity for their fans, right up until they don't. The thing that makes this book so much fun is that each example is interesting and will take many readers back to that time. So there is that nostalgia fun. There is also the fun that comes from being given the opportunity to think more deeply about an area we often only pretend to give serious thought to, art forms that serve to entertain. Will a reader come away with a more sympathetic and understanding position about their old favorite band that ""sold out?"" Will the reader think just a bit longer about throwing this particular label on future celebrities that make a move or change that could be interpreted as selling out? Hard to say, the accusation alone offers a form of consolation when we feel left behind by our favorites, so we may well still hurl it. Maybe we will also know in our hearts that things are never quite that simple and clear cut.

The cover had fingerprints on it but whatever- my fingerprints will soon cover those lol. The loss of such a bright, brilliant, beyond talented soul has been, at times, too much to bear‚Ä¶ but reading accounts from those close to him remind me that not only was Mac Miller incredibly brilliant, but Malcolm was a loving, smart, kind, and humble human being. That, along with his genius content, has made him my all time favorite. I‚Äôve always said he was too good for this earth and that‚Äôs why he was taken. He was an old soul and too bright of a light. Literally miss him every day and I can‚Äôt think about the fact that we won‚Äôt get to see his career continue. It‚Äôs truly a tragedy. His fans, however, are die hard and we will keep his memory alive for generations to come. Thank you Donna, for your insight.

"A revealing look behind the scenes of the Sopranos...","There have been tons of Soprano 'gear' since the show ended in 2007 -- books, cookbooks, CDs, podcasts, even calendars and puzzles. But I've found nothing that encompasses the 'whole thing' like WOKE UP THIS MORNING. The revealing, poignant and sometimes hilarious memories of Sopranos' actors Michael Imperiole (Christopher), and Steve Schirripa (Bobby Baccalieri), are augmented by many hours of new interviews with Imperiole, Schirripa, Steve Van Zandt, David Chase, Lorraine Bracco and many others from the Sopranos set. Sharply assembled by long-time journalist Phil Lerman (of America's Most Wanted fame), the book is an unflinching look at the challenges of getting the show on TV in the first place, and how the actors reacted and grew with their roles. Most celebrity interviews usually devolve into he or she 'was a pleasure to work with' platitudes. Not so with WOKE UP, where tensions and laughter on the set share the pages with the ultimate triumph of a show that changed not only television but the creative talents involved.","06 Nov 2021","","","Yes","David Colton","5.0","Woke Up This Morning: The Definitive Oral History of The Sopranos","https://www.amazon.com/Woke-Up-This-Morning-Definitive-ebook/product-reviews/B08W584YZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews","Enabled","R16F4UOTEQTZ45"
"Phenomenal","For all the naysayers on here saying this is not a book - fuhgetaboutit. This is an oral history which happens to my favorite type of memoir. Everybody who's anybody from the show was interviewed. With the exception of Tony Sirico, which they don't really address why.  I had to to google him to see if he was still alive. The hallmark of any good book (that's right clowns, this is a great book), is that you don't want it to end. I loved this book so much I would only limit myself to a few chapters at a time to prolong it. Simply wonderful, personal, intimate, behind the scenes remembrances from cast and crew.

"Perfect for soprano fans","I love The Sopranos, the fictional characters, the actors who brought them to life, the unparalleled writing, the laughing out loud humor, the fascinating parts about organized crime and, of course, the superb music used to elevate and enrich the experience. I have watched the series 3 times and now I am re-watching it with my wife due to the fact that HBO added audio descriptions which also offer a lot of insight into the story and the characters. Really excited that they did this in 2021. This is one of those incredibly rare shows that gets even better every time you are watching it again. The Woke Up This Morning audiobook dives even further into all the events surrounding the show and each of the guests will share with us those facts in their own voice, which I always appreciate. I‚Äôve been waiting for this audiobook for a few months now and today I am really excited to be able to finally listen to it. From cast members to writers and other people involved with the production, each of them will tell their story about how they were a part of The Sopranos. The Talking Sopranos podcast is also a great resource for those who love the best show in the world and I highly recommend it as well to real fans. If you are the fan that I think you are, you cannot pass the opportunity to listen to this audiobook!

"Woke Up This Morning","I love, love the Sopranos ... I saw it when it originally aired 20 years, I have seen the series at least a half dozen times over, and I never miss the Podcast. Love Michael and Stevel. However, this is NOT a book it is a transcript of the podcast interviews on Talking Sopranos.  So many of the interviews I heard on the podcast is rehashed in this so-called book.  I also believe most of the people they interviewed were NOT the actual actors in the series, they do not sound anything like the actors themselves.  This is a transcript of the podcast read by people other than the true cast, and writers.  They didn't fool me.  This is better as audible than as a book, this is not a book.

That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs over 500 pages, I have a life and there‚Äôs just so many hours in a day one can read. So anyone who posted negative reviews of Woke Up This Morning a day or two after it came out are full of it. They skimmed it, read a few things they heard on the podcast, and immediately assumed the entire book is a transcript. News flash:  It‚Äôs not.  It‚Äôs much more than that.  Broken down season by season, has brand new interviews,  awesome color photos and so much more. Yes there‚Äôs some overlap here and there, but so what? If you‚Äôre a true Sopranos fan you‚Äôll love every page. Michael & Steve did a great job putting this together. Seems like they actually made an effort to add extra material because they didn‚Äôt want this to be a podcast transcript.  They succeeded.
